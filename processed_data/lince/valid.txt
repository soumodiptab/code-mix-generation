<begin> hi the movie i want to talk to you about today is steven spielbergs jaws it has a <number> review on rotten tomatoes and has a <number> <number> imdb rating <end>	<begin> namaste aaj main jis philm ke baare mein aapase baat karana chaahata hoon vah hai steven spielberg kee jaws <end>
<begin> yes that was worth a one time watch back in the <number> s <end>	<begin> haan yah <number> ke dashak mein ek baar dekhane laayak tha <end>
<begin> so do you agree with the ratings of the movie many people find it to be a scary thriller but others describe it as being too gruesome what do you think do you like this kind of movie <end>	<begin> to kya aap philm kee reting se sahamat hain kaee logon ko yah ek daraavana thrilar lagata hai lekin any log ise bheeshan bataate hain tum kya sochate ho kya aapako is tarah kee philm pasand hai <end>
<begin> i found it to be to gruesome and didnt agree with the rating but then i dont like violent movies <end>	<begin> i found it to be to gruesome aur reting se sahamat nahin tha lekin phir mujhe hinsak philmen pasand nahin hain <end>
<begin> i hear ya but maybe you should give it another try its a classic movie full of action and suspense steven spielberg never disappoints do you typically like steven spielberg movies <end>	<begin> main aapakee baat sunata hoonlekin shaayad aapako ise ek aur koshish denee chaahie yah ekshan aur saspens se bharapoor klaasik philm hai steven spielberg kabhee niraash nahin karatekya aap aamataur par steevan speelabarg philmen pasand karate hain <end>
<begin> im not sure as to whether id like to give it another try or not but then again i liked et <end>	<begin> mujhe yakeen nahin hai ki kya main ise ek aur koshish dena chaahoonga ya nahin lekin phir mujhe eetee pasand aaya <end>
<begin> well like one person put it its funny in a woody allen sort of way since its a classic it might not be exactly as you remember might be worth the watch even if just for the laughs <end>	<begin> khair jaise ek vyakti ne ise rakha yah ek tarah se vudee elan kee tarah mazedaar haichoonki yah ek klaasik hai yah theek vaisa nahin ho sakata jaisa aap yaad karate hain bhale hee sirph hansee ke lie ghadee dekhane laayak ho <end>
<begin> perhaps the humor is subtle i recall not really seeing to much humor in it though <end>	<begin> shaayad haasy sookshm hai mujhe yaad hai ki vaastav mein isamen jyaada haasy dekhane ko nahin mila <end>
<begin> well i suppose the film works for both types of people some love it because of its action and because its a scary thriller while others find it to be more humorous and funny <end>	<begin> khair mujhe lagata hai ki philm donon tarah ke logon ke lie kaam karatee hai kuchh ko isake ekshan se pyaar hai aur kyonki yah ek daraavana thrilar hai jabaki any ise adhik vinodee aur majaakiya samajhate hain <end>
<begin> thats true and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor people like or dont care for <end>	<begin> yah sach hai aur shaayad yah bhee haasy ke prakaar ke logon ke saath bahut kuchh karana hai ya paravaah nahin hai <end>
<begin> yeah thats true but of course most watch it for the thrill for example there is a scene in the movie where a woman named chrissie watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean while shes in the water shes suddenly pulled under its unexpected and thrilling one of the reasons why i enjoy this movie <end>	<begin> haan voh sach hein par jyada log us thrill ke liye dekhenge udharan voh movie me yek scene yek aurat uska naam chrissie watkins skinny dipping karthi thi ocean mein jab voh pani mein hein achanak use upper pull kar the hein voh toh unexpected aur thrill bhi hein muje toh us movie dekhkar badi kushi huvi <end>
<begin> i honestly dont know what else to say this has been going on way too long and is honestly silly im going to return the hit hopefully you can abort the conversation and still get paid this is terrible <end>	<begin> muje kuch patha nahi ab vaakahi mein mein kya kahun voh toh bahut long ja raha hein aur voh silly bhi hein mein toh return karne vala hoon us hit ko isse aapka conversation abort hoga magar aapko paid bhi hoga voh terrible hein yar <end>

<begin> nick wilde <end>	<begin> nick wilde <end>
<begin> who was yours <end>	<begin> aapka konsa <end>
<begin> oh okay my favorite character was judy hopps my favorite scene of the movie was when she got initially put as a parking duty cop <end>	<begin> acha mera favorite character toh judy hoops hein mera favorite scene is movie mein toh jab voh uska duty cop apni parking se shuru ki <end>
<begin> i like the movie because it was something that both me and my children enjoyed <end>	<begin> muje is movie pasand hein kyon ki mein aur mera bachon bahut enjoy kiye hein <end>
<begin> i actually watched it at a friends house because her <number> year old had it on repeat <end>	<begin> mein toh apni doston ke saath dekha kyon ki uska <number> saal beta ko fir se dekhne ka man kiya <end>
<begin> oh how funny do you think that the imdb rating is appropriate <end>	<begin> acha kitna funny hein kya aapko laga ki imdb ka rating appropriate hota hein <end>
<begin> i do <number> <number> seems right the rotten tomatoes review seems high but its impressive <end>	<begin> haan yar <number> <number> toh right hi hota rotten tomatoes ka review bhi high hota muje pasand hein <end>
<begin> i agree rotten tomatoes usually has horrible ratings so it is a bit surprising i like the main theme that people cant be judged based on their color well in this case species <end>	<begin> yeh sahi baat hai ki rotten tomatoes ki ratings kharab hoti hai usually isiliye yeh todha surprising hai mujhe main theme acchi kagi jaha log judge nahi kiye ja rahe apne rang k liye kam se kam is case species me <end>
<begin> what holiday was this released around <end>	<begin> kis chutti k aap pass yeh release hui tha <end>
<begin> do you think judy recording nick was an ethical decision <end>	<begin> kya tumhe lagta ki judy ne nick ko jo record kia wo ethical tha <end>
<begin> i dont recall the holiday i do think that it was ethical because he was a wanted suspect so she was just doing her job <end>	<begin> mujhe holiday yaad nahi par mujhe yeh zarur lagta ki yeh ethical tha kyuki wo ek wanted suspect tha aur wo sirf apna kaam kar rahi thi <end>
<begin> i think the ending made up for her recording because she realized that nicks past being bullied had a huge effect on him <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai jo ending thi usne sab sahi kar dia kyuki usko realize hua ki nick ki past me jo bulling hui wo uspar kaafi effect ki hai <end>
<begin> i also thought it was super unfair of bogo to request her resignation so quickly she was still new to the force <end>	<begin> mujhe yeh bhi laga ki yeh bohot unfair tha jo bogo ne usse resignation maanga kyu wo abhi nayi thi force me <end>
<begin> i agree with that it was unfair however she got tricked by nick on her first day i honestly dont think she was qualified for the position <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi yeh baat sahi lagi wo nayi thi halaki wo pehle din hi nick se trick ho gayi wo is position k liye qualified hi nahi thi <end>
<begin> she was a bit naive but she also shouldnt have been out alone as a rookie <end>	<begin> wo todhi pagal thi magar use akele aise rookie par nahi jana tha <end>
<begin> i loved bellwethers character i know shes a bad guy but jenny slate does such a good job <end>	<begin> mujhe bellwethers ka character sabse mast laga mujhe pata hai wo buri thi usme magar jenny slate ne bohot accha kaam kia <end>
<begin> i have to agree with you on that i dont see her as much of a bad guy since she offered nick and judy access to the security cameras <end>	<begin> mai tumse sehmat hu ispar mujhe wo itni buri bhi nahi lagi kyuki usne nick aur judy ko security camera ka access dia <end>
<begin> in the end when judy asked nick to join the zootopia police department do you think that was a good call on her part <end>	<begin> end mein jab judy ne nick se zootopia police department ko join karne kaha tha toh kya aap isse ache call kahe jaayenge <end>
<begin> probably not just because he ended up liking her doesnt mean he had completely turned himself around <end>	<begin> bilkul nahi yar kyon ki end mein usne pyar toh kiya lekin uska pura nahi usse diya <end>
<begin> yeah the movie didnt show nick developing enough for him to be trusted with that kind of authority plus i am guessing that his criminal background wouldnt go well <end>	<begin> haan is movie mein toh nick neh uska trust aur authority nahi develop ki aur muje guess hein ki voh criminal background mein jarur nahi aayega <end>
<begin> it was sweet when nick stuck up for judy when bogo tried to demand her to quit <end>	<begin> voh toh pyara tha jab nick nei judy ke liye stuckup kiya jab bogo nei use quit karne ka demand kiya <end>
<begin> i agree he definitely showed some development there possibly just gratitude <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon voh toh kuch development showed kiya kuch gratitude bhi <end>
<begin> did you think that the use of drugs in the movie was a bit too much the creation of drugs i should say <end>	<begin> kya aap ko kuch aise nahi laga ki movies mein drug ka usage kuch jaasti tha <end>
<begin> i think it was innocent enough probably too complicated of a plot line to really do any harm to kids <end>	<begin> muje lagtha hein ki voh innocent tha aur kuch plot line mein add kiye honge toh voh aur complicated ban saktha aur kids ke liye toh harm ho saktha tha <end>
<begin> they could get the jist of it that bellwether made the wolves do bad things but beyond that they probably didnt relate it to drugs as we think of them <end>	<begin> jo kiya so paayega jab wolves ne bad things kiya lekin voh drug se relate nahi kiya jo hum soch rahe they <end>
<begin> i know what you mean <end>	<begin> muje patha hein aap kya aap bole <end>
<begin> my young cousin asked me what they were and why he was making them what they do to people etc so it might not influence most children but definitely some <end>	<begin> mera choti cousin pucha ki voh kya hein aur kyon us loog kon hein aur bla bla isliye mein children ko nahi influence karne devunga <end>
