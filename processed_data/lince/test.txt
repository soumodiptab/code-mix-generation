<begin> yeah it has a bunch of great scenes where the two dont quite connect <end>	
<begin> yes it is good <end>	
<begin> i mean creature sorry <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> me too the more unexpected the better <end>	
<begin> i think they have a strong defense to beat the chitauri invaders <end>	
<begin> plus how many times are you going to leave your kid behind i see they added another scene how the robbers got caught and kevin reuniting with his mom and family <end>	
<begin> but reading the introduction makes me want to watch it again <end>	
<begin> yeah even though i love comedies this wasnt <number> of my faves <end>	
<begin> nice <end>	
<begin> i enjoyed it one of my favored comic book adaptations <end>	
<begin> yes there are two sequels to the original and those are just as great <end>	
<begin> oh and maleficent is the dark witch <end>	
<begin> did jennifer aniston know that he has god powers i do not remember that part <end>	
<begin> that is a good scene they are refering to when aurelio tells him something like john wick is the boogeyman or something lol <end>	
<begin> ok sounds interesting did she witness anything she did not suppose to at her workplace <end>	
<begin> i loved the story how true they made it in how teen girls act but i honestly dont know why i didnt rate it highly as all the right ingredients were there i cannot believe it was <number> it was released though <number> years ago <end>	
<begin> yes you definitely should <end>	
<begin> hi there <end>	
<begin> i think all <number> were fair <end>	
<begin> do you like old movies <end>	
<begin> oh i love steve carroll <end>	
<begin> i do i adore sci fi you <end>	
<begin> hi <end>	
<begin> even cinemascore that usually is more reliable only gave it a b <end>	
<begin> that is very high <end>	
<begin> one of the things i wasnt a fan of was the fact that mia didnt really have any development <end>	
<begin> that good <end>	
<begin> uh oh <end>	
<begin> wait it was actually <number> im sorry <end>	
<begin> turing proposaes marrige and is accepted but admits he is a homosexual <end>	
<begin> that sounds funny i like morgan freeman <end>	
<begin> me too i also loved how ariadne had to construct each dream level <end>	
<begin> the metacritic score is <number> <end>	
<begin> umm based on cast mainly i have different taste from most people and ratings <end>	
<begin> dram biopic movie <end>	
<begin> now another key scene was added <end>	
<begin> do you know when it came ou <end>	
<begin> the ratings are very low for both rotten tomatoes and metacritic <end>	
<begin> were done though anyway rember next time <end>	
<begin> it was rated very highly by critics all over the world <end>	
<begin> ive never seen it whats it about <end>	
<begin> not necessarily but i think that can help an actor doesnt become high profile unless they are really good at what they do what do you think <end>	
<begin> i see what you mean <end>	
<begin> <number> out of <number> or <number> <end>	
<begin> hey still here <end>	
<begin> i liked it a lot and i think its among my favorites <end>	
<begin> hello how are you <end>	
<begin> it was sad that he died at the end <end>	
<begin> i figured it was a drama film <end>	
<begin> thats more that possilbe <end>	
<begin> i think you watched this movie also <end>	
<begin> indeed it is shall we talk movies <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> ok sorry mine looked as though it did but its the same story <end>	
<begin> yes i just watched la la land <end>	
<begin> andd you wouldnt want to get in the bad side of ms perkins played by adrianne palicky <end>	
<begin> sure thats the point of the self help book for girls high school can be pretty tough and the movie makes it light of that andat the same time turns it into silly self examination of how kids behave its not without a basis that rolling stones called a comic gold <end>	
<begin> interesting <end>	
<begin> i really hope wonder woman is the start of some good superhero movies from dc <end>	
<begin> they loved it they spent the next few days speaking in minion speak <end>	
<begin> yea ot was <end>	
<begin> i will be finding out soon lol i am going to guess that american pie being no i love the irony of cady breaking the plastic crown at the end <end>	
<begin> its about a mute cleaner and she works at a secret government lab <end>	
<begin> who was mccorom again <end>	
<begin> i dont know if youve heard of this little animate feature call toy story lol <end>	
<begin> i wanted to see the wonder woman movie because its the only movie with a female superhero as the main character <end>	
<begin> not familiar with him but a good movie <end>	
<begin> the movie just jumped forward passed that seb didnt have much growth either he stayed a jazz snob <end>	
<begin> good clean fun for the entire family <end>	
<begin> it has good ratings too and the cast are so talented <end>	
<begin> that is a good part of the movie i cant imagine how the mom felt <end>	
<begin> i think she would be forever remember as wonder woman as christopher reeves will be superman <end>	
<begin> the woman leaving her home to be with the man is the same old thing that always happens in movies <end>	
<begin> no i didnt see it <end>	
<begin> i will definitely see you soon <end>	
<begin> i think those people did not like the idea of morgan freeman as a god <end>	
<begin> yah thank you so much this was a great conversatilm <end>	
<begin> oh no i agree with you wholeheartedly the trilogy ended to well for there to be a continuation <end>	
<begin> was it human like as far as communication goes <end>	
<begin> i agree <end>	
<begin> the shape of water was pretty good id rate it as one of guillermo del toros best movies <end>	
<begin> haha <end>	
<begin> how do we know when this task is complete <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> its definitely an original idea <end>	
<begin> no <end>	
<begin> i like things i can share with my parents <end>	
<begin> great <end>	
<begin> don rickles and tom hanks are great <end>	
<begin> john wick <number> was actually terrible nothing as good as the first one <end>	
<begin> ill have to check this one out for sure ah that makes sense the beginning set up the plot for conning <end>	
<begin> so would you go see this movie <end>	
<begin> ive heard of it whats it about <end>	
<begin> i am not sure on that but spielburg is blessed with talent many moviemakers dont posses he actually know how to tell a story <end>	
<begin> yes it was <end>	
<begin> it was hilarious how macaulay culkin got the crooks so many time <end>	
<begin> i see that i didnt remember that was the moms name even i better rewatch it and refresh my memory <end>	
<begin> same here <end>	
<begin> the enigma machine is an important historical item <end>	
<begin> it sounds like it would be my kind of thing <end>	
<begin> yes you definitely should <end>	
<begin> like one where the girl mia hears the boy sebastian playing the piano in a bar but he brushes her off <end>	
<begin> additionally steve carroll and jennifer aniston are in it too <end>	
<begin> that makes sense i just didnt remember that being his name i have a neighbor named marley too but she is young and a girl lol <end>	
<begin> i agree with them that ruffalo was great in the movie <end>	
<begin> yes he got involved with christopher morcom who sparked his interest in crypto <end>	
<begin> i think maybe the top part the key scene changed <end>	
<begin> exactly but when he works there he starts to get the itch to get back into conning and carl who works at the fbi is constantly worried carl is gonna disappear again <end>	
<begin> but we werent shown how she found the thing that helped her grow and become a better actress <end>	
<begin> what do you think about the th scene <end>	
<begin> you <end>	
<begin> and good to know you had a dachshund too interesting <end>	
<begin> additionally steve carroll and jennifer aniston are in it too <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> sadly no they drift away as their careers go in different directions he misses an important play and she moves back home <end>	
<begin> my favorite character is probably angelina jolies because she is a great actress <end>	
<begin> im usually not a huge fan but it seemed very genuine <end>	
<begin> i can take or leave jen aniston <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> great you will really enjoy it im sure <end>	
<begin> i think she is still a good person just jaded <end>	
<begin> would love to hear about it <end>	
<begin> turing proposaes marrige and is accepted but admits he is a homosexual <end>	
<begin> are there any other famous actors beside emma and ryan <end>	
<begin> yes marvel is far better but all disney is good <end>	
<begin> morcom was the man who sparked turings interest in cryptography <end>	
<begin> no problem <end>	
<begin> i think he overdid it a bit a little to over the top i know ares is a god and all but i rolled my eyes everytime he showed up on screen <end>	
<begin> cool story factor about him tryingto be fired <end>	
<begin> it is kinda open ended ending <end>	
<begin> well frank settles down at the fbi its assumed and as the credits roll it is revealed the frank has been married and happy for <number> years has <number> sons and lives in the midwest and still maintains a friendship with carl <end>	
<begin> no never saw it any good <end>	
<begin> very much so but as a bonus there are some clever inside jokes that play to parents and grandparents its definitely appropriate for a family movie night the overall theme is the importance of family and teaamwork <end>	
<begin> i remember seeing this movie as a child and thought it was very funny <end>	
<begin> it was rated very highly by critics all over the world <end>	
<begin> well aurora refers to maleficent as her fairy godmother <end>	
<begin> i might have to watch it to see what you mean i think failing and trying again shows real depth <end>	
<begin> does it have a happy ending <end>	
<begin> also just visually beautiful <end>	
<begin> hi do you like it i loved how keanu reeves acts <end>	
<begin> can you tell me the name of any good movie you have seen recently <end>	
<begin> i think he did a great job tho <end>	
<begin> perfect <end>	
<begin> career wise or personal like <end>	
<begin> i wasnt sure about those two to start out with they just didnt seem like theyd be good together <end>	
<begin> not necessarily but i think that can help an actor doesnt become high profile unless they are really good at what they do what do you think <end>	
<begin> sure <end>	
<begin> user <number> left the chat now what do i do <end>	
<begin> oh wow disney you did a good one <end>	
<begin> what do you think about the defense of the team <end>	
<begin> sometimes i think my kids will choose the latter i need to indoctrinate the better <end>	
<begin> i thought it was super romantic <end>	
<begin> i agree them great in the avengers movie <end>	
<begin> my wife had a huge crush on christopher reeve from the superman movies back in the <number> s has basically said she would divorce me if i saw these new movies <end>	
<begin> a bit he has a duet with emma he also sings a song or two by himself <end>	
<begin> well she meets and falls in love with a boy named stefan <end>	
<begin> i love it too i also enjoy movies that mess with your mind or give you something you werent expecting <end>	
<begin> i think using love to fight war is the same old thing <end>	
<begin> it was too dramatic for a comedy movie <end>	
<begin> same with the director mark waters i cannot think of any other movies he directed but surely he must have made more successful films <end>	
<begin> i think the description up top got longer <end>	
<begin> i prefer sci fy but got this vid instead <end>	
<begin> but we werent shown how she found the thing that helped her grow and become a better actress <end>	
<begin> bye <end>	
<begin> morcom was the man who sparked turings interest in cryptography <end>	
<begin> ah i see who plays him <end>	
<begin> she is very good <end>	
<begin> he did make many good movies what are some of your favorites was this the first time you saw jaws <end>	
<begin> yes its quite interesting because he relies on forging checks so there is some tense moments where youre kind of rooting for him even though hes a con man the premise is in the title catch me if you can <end>	
<begin> i see thats lol n its sad <end>	
<begin> yes that was instrumental to solving the mysteries of the enigma machine <end>	
<begin> hi <end>	
<begin> i like them whats this one about <end>	
<begin> hello how are you i am not entirely sure about what question to ask so ill just ask do you think the critics were fair in their critique of the movie <end>	
<begin> how are you <end>	
<begin> so good <end>	
<begin> makes hoe schooling very appealing i love how the mean girls are known as the plastics all fake <end>	
<begin> do you remember your favorite scene <end>	
<begin> movie was cvool ioverall <end>	
<begin> im usually not a huge fan but it seemed very genuine <end>	
<begin> i think i will <end>	
<begin> sorry <end>	
<begin> he was very good <end>	
<begin> you dont think so <end>	
<begin> no busty is andys dog by the way im just kidding yeah he is like the dad kind of role in the family of toys since well he is mr potato head hahaha <end>	
<begin> enjoy it <end>	
<begin> the atmosphere of the amazons and their training was the art of my favorites <end>	
<begin> is it an animation <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> watching it as an adult now you see it from a different perspective <end>	
<begin> he doesnt because he loves mia so much he wants to make her proud <end>	
<begin> well i dont know how you feel about romantic comedies <end>	
<begin> which was your favorite part <end>	
<begin> it is a science fiction comedy hybrid <end>	
<begin> its a really different movie its been one of my favorites ive seen in a long time <end>	
<begin> <number> <end>	
<begin> it sounds like it would be my kind of thing <end>	
<begin> yea film critics are too stiff you should watch this movie <end>	
<begin> what did you think of general erich aries <end>	
<begin> i bet i would too <end>	
<begin> good have you heard of actor jim carrey <end>	
<begin> i have and thoroughly enjoyed it how about you <end>	
<begin> oh yeah what year did it come out <end>	
<begin> i can agree <end>	
<begin> it sounds like something i would watch than you for the recommendation <end>	
<begin> i think i was pretty young when i saw it the first time i remember blood but not all the gruesome scenes i doubt my children have seen it <end>	
<begin> overall i like the movie it has some high profile actors what about you <end>	
<begin> i will admit wonder woman is the first dc movie ive seen since christopher nolans dark knight movies i do not like the new superman movies <end>	
<begin> so there is a bit of diversity in the film that sounds cool <end>	
<begin> there were some complaints that its too pat say everything went so smoothly despite all the pain the boy had endured b c of his drug addict mother feeling unloved that sort of awful thing aside from what i mentioned above the moms racist friends whom she rebukes i dont know about any other backlash what did you hear <end>	
<begin> ummm no spoiler <end>	
<begin> hi <end>	
<begin> sorry <end>	
<begin> they werent the best signers ive ever heard but it wasnt like le mes bad <end>	
<begin> it makes me want to watch it again how many did they make three <end>	
<begin> i like them a lot the imitation game was a good example of this <end>	
<begin> is it easily rented online <end>	
<begin> ih <end>	
<begin> i think from the title i would say the fact that theres animals and its a kid friendly movie <end>	
<begin> robert downy jr played tony spark <end>	
<begin> yes i just watched la la land <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> i know it was the perfect trilogy <end>	
<begin> ok thank you bye <end>	
<begin> you can either think about it as sad or happy <end>	
<begin> names his machine christopher <end>	
<begin> tell me about a character <end>	
<begin> i watched parts here and there so i was rather vague on some details <end>	
<begin> that is like true love <end>	
<begin> hello how are you have you seen any good movies recently <end>	
<begin> yes it was all so real <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> the movie was good above average for sure but not astounding which is a fine thing for a movie yes <end>	
<begin> oh my god i love actors were there any others <end>	
<begin> do you remember the train that plows through downtown la <end>	
<begin> <number> min <end>	
<begin> it was captured by secret government laboratory <end>	
<begin> i like them whats this one about <end>	
<begin> and she kidnapped it to save its life and kept it in her bathtup <end>	
<begin> hi <end>	
<begin> only female super hero so far <end>	
<begin> ohh <end>	
<begin> i havent seen maleficent <end>	
<begin> it looks like aurora told stefan about maleficent <end>	
<begin> i dont recognize it either what position does he play in the movie <end>	
<begin> do you agree with the ratings of the movie <end>	
<begin> it was really hard to see the puppy get killed it evoked so many emotions of sadness and anger <end>	
<begin> what did you think of the movie what was wrong with it <end>	
<begin> and yes he does decide to go to college the parts w the tutor are in pursuit of that the family and miss sue all work together to help him catch up on the work hes missed and move forward too <end>	
<begin> i also saw the movie as a kid i remember it being funny <end>	
<begin> downey jr chris evans ruffalo hemsworth johnasson are amazing actors <end>	
<begin> i think the cast was top notch <end>	
<begin> i watched parts here and there so i was rather vague on some details <end>	
<begin> yeah me too was great talking to you take care <end>	
<begin> rich reserves of humor <end>	
<begin> yes see you soon too <end>	
<begin> he doesnt because he loves mia so much he wants to make her proud <end>	
<begin> hello how are you have you seen any good movies recently <end>	
<begin> who was mccorom again <end>	
<begin> i watched it at least twice it was that good i love female superheros <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> they liked it <end>	
<begin> when he brought the moon close to her <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> how did the avengers become divided <end>	
<begin> i wish it is still perfect i dont like the idea of movies surpassing a trilogy but that is just my opinion but i always trust pixar haha <end>	
<begin> and the sequel as well <end>	
<begin> i have seen trailers and such and a few bits here and there of batman superman but cant make myself watch it <end>	
<begin> i think you should its an enjoyable watch that makes you think bye <end>	
<begin> you should try watching the <number> film jaws it has a rating of <number> on rotten tomatoes <end>	
<begin> oh right because she has a fairy godmother i love the multi universe concept disney did that with marvel <end>	
<begin> what kind of emotions <end>	
<begin> also highly recognizable thats a plothole in my opinion <end>	
<begin> out <end>	
<begin> any reviews <end>	
<begin> bye <end>	
<begin> you dont think so <end>	
<begin> it sounds like something i would watch than you for the recommendation <end>	
<begin> yes the director of it was morten tyldum <end>	
<begin> yeah it is a perfect animated featureb <end>	
<begin> that definitely makes it sound a little better i heard there was some backlash about the racial parts of the movie do you think any part of the movie made you uncomfortable <end>	
<begin> i agree this is more of a historical film like the scenes where britain declares war on germany <end>	
<begin> yes he is awesome in it <end>	
<begin> yes and a well crafted one at that it was produced by universal its obviously digitally animated more along the lines of pixar movies and the soundtrack is amazing <end>	
<begin> i agree them great in the avengers movie <end>	
<begin> i love that movie it helped me as a kid to take care of my toys and i am being serious <end>	
<begin> it is a humanoid amphibian <end>	
<begin> hi how are you <end>	
<begin> and all the action was good <end>	
<begin> same enjoy ur day <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> i assume that was named after christopher morcom <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> lol i mean he was playing god so it had o be a lil dramtic <end>	
<begin> thanks for telling me about it sounds really interesting <end>	
<begin> exactly <end>	
<begin> how descriptive <end>	
<begin> frank is gonna disappear again sorry for the typo got excited <end>	
<begin> i think they have a strong defense to beat the chitauri invaders <end>	
<begin> did she release it back <end>	
<begin> i love home alone when it came it great movie <end>	
<begin> im suprised its so low <end>	
<begin> i didnt know that <end>	
<begin> pharrel wrote the main theme song and performs it the lyrics are peppy and comical there are other contemporary and classical pieces that help weave the narrative together <end>	
<begin> do you watch movies based on the cast or the rating <end>	
<begin> of course <end>	
<begin> and without a doubt she is a great actress <end>	
<begin> its been awhile but ive seen it too it was really good <end>	
<begin> ooh i loved seeing that part in the theater as soon as the screen cut to black you could hear everyones frustration <end>	
<begin> of coarse <end>	
<begin> do you think the genre should be drama <end>	
<begin> amazing hoiw technogoly has advanced <end>	
<begin> marvels the avengers is a <number> american superhero film based on the marvel comics superhero team of the same name produced by marvel studios and distributed by walt disneystudios motion pictures <end>	
<begin> yes i did <end>	
<begin> yeah you cant just copy paste what would be the point <end>	
<begin> i h avent seen it no <end>	
<begin> also steve carrell is the main character in the sequel evan almighty <end>	
<begin> i think my favorite bit was actually at the end when youre not sure if dom is in reality or notwhen the scene cuts away from the top before you know if it stops spinning or not <end>	
<begin> i think i will <end>	
<begin> the movie just jumped forward passed that seb didnt have much growth either he stayed a jazz snob <end>	
<begin> yes hes quite good <end>	
<begin> in what sense where does it take place <end>	
<begin> that is sad <end>	
<begin> at one point frank is arrested an taken to jail and there is a flash forward where it skips in time but eventually tom hanks carl hanratty in the film convinces the fbi to take frank on to work with them <end>	
<begin> i know im so curious now i will definitely check it out this weekend <end>	
<begin> menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work so they can never tell anything about the machines <end>	
<begin> in what sense <end>	
<begin> without the crypo anbalyssi would have been very hard during ww <end>	
<begin> the plot seems pretty good to me so it is definitely award worthy <end>	
<begin> our movie was titled superhero <end>	
<begin> its a big wrong place wrong time kind of ending which sucks because you really start to root for them <end>	
<begin> how would have you rated this movie <end>	
<begin> did you think that it was a sad part of the movie <end>	
<begin> well this film takes place back when prejudice is still very common and the main character is best friends with a black woman and a gay man so it really delves into that <end>	
<begin> wow maleficent tried to let stefan live and stefan just had forever rage for her <end>	
<begin> yea film critics are too stiff you should watch this movie <end>	
<begin> so aurora is supposed to be sleeping beauty <end>	
<begin> what do you think about the defense of the team <end>	
<begin> emma stone and ryan gosling play the leads <end>	
<begin> hi <end>	
<begin> i meant <number> <end>	
<begin> the main character is an orphan who was found in a river <end>	
<begin> ive heard of it whats it about <end>	
<begin> wait so there is no prince charming <end>	
<begin> benedict cumberbatch was a great actor in the lead role <end>	
<begin> yes i saw the movie with my children <end>	
<begin> it made me want to go back to see her <end>	
<begin> its a big wrong place wrong time kind of ending which sucks because you really start to root for them <end>	
<begin> and the sequel as well <end>	
<begin> id give it a good strong nine <end>	
<begin> hi there this is like one of my favorite movies <end>	
<begin> downey jr chris evans ruffalo hemsworth johnasson are amazing actors <end>	
<begin> i think you are refering to alfie allen performance that was not shi top notch <end>	
<begin> what is your initial opinion on the movie without going into depth do you like it or not <end>	
<begin> during this time seb feels so out of sorts the band hes in is finding success in pop music but because hes such a jazz pureist he wants to quit <end>	
<begin> i agree i think i saw all of them but i dont remember them that well im even thinking the last one wasnt the same characters but i could be wrong <end>	
<begin> rich reserves of humor <end>	
<begin> i may try to see if my nieces can come over and watch it too <end>	
<begin> they meet and fall in love in la while pursing their dreams <end>	
<begin> hahaha <end>	
<begin> well they meet for a second time at a party and seb is in a <number> s cover band they have this chemistry that is ignored and they go on with their lives for a while <end>	
<begin> the actor was robert downey jr <end>	
<begin> awesome im going to have to check that out <end>	
<begin> or rather does a movie need high profile actors to be good <end>	
<begin> very clever woman it def stood out from all the other american teen movies that were so popular around that time <end>	
<begin> then they slowly start falling for each other over the course of a few dates <end>	
<begin> well i want to watch the movie now <end>	
<begin> i was told that the super batman movie was trash <end>	
<begin> yes they used it to decrypt the messages the nazis were sending <end>	
<begin> well thats the take away being a super hero or a super villain is entirely your choice gru ends up being a super hero by vanquishing vector the up and coming villain <end>	
<begin> have you seen it <end>	
<begin> this was one of lindsay lohans bigger successes it made her very well known although i think it made amanda seyfried well known too she was so pretty in this film it made a fan out of me <end>	
<begin> jim carrey things nothing goes right for him and complains to god morgan freeman plays god and lets him play god for a week <end>	
<begin> hey <end>	
<begin> whats the story line <end>	
<begin> does he get to sing <end>	
<begin> yes the main antagonist is the man who brought the creature to the lab richard strickland <end>	
<begin> do they make it in the end both as a couple and in their respective careers <end>	
<begin> also very good <end>	
<begin> its like sleeping beauty but not animated <end>	
<begin> they werent the best signers ive ever heard but it wasnt like le mes bad <end>	
<begin> yeah but still jim carreys having an accident and the whole love drama <end>	
<begin> i find it hard to believe rotten tomatos ratings also it should be like at least a <number> or <number> <end>	
<begin> john legend has a small role <end>	
<begin> so the figure became her best friend huh <end>	
<begin> so it ends a bit sadly then but i guess thats how real life goes <end>	
<begin> or rather does a movie need high profile actors to be good <end>	
<begin> it was directed by jon favreau <end>	
<begin> wow i kinda figure that <end>	
<begin> near the end where she literally redirects the lighting to kill ares yours <end>	
<begin> dram biopic movie <end>	
<begin> hi <end>	
<begin> did you see the shape of water <end>	
<begin> i never seen it before please tell me about the film <end>	
<begin> not dislike per se but there were elements that were harder to watch for example the scene w the mothers racist friends was disturbing not least b c it was so realistic and when michael goes back to his childhood home and his time with the gang members there turns violent its stressful and sad to think it might derail michaels future <end>	
<begin> i think i saw that many many years ago how many jaws movies did they make <end>	
<begin> yea that was cool <end>	
<begin> thanks for having the chat <end>	
<begin> sorry didnt see the chat had started <number> out <number> <end>

<begin> ah that sounds goodthough i wouldnt mind seeing this plot with catwoman in the lead <end>	
<begin> would agree and i like to warch keira knightly too <end>	
<begin> i will admit she did a good job she always seemed too small for the role maybe im just comparing it to the <number> s tv show <end>	
<begin> it was quite cute created by illumination entertainment in <number> the main story follows an aging supervillian named gru gru has a posse of minions who do the heavy lifting for him <end>	
<begin> hello <end>

<begin> user <number> left the chat now what do i do <end>	
<begin> <number> shows compared to shows now are very different <end>	
<begin> who in it <end>	
<begin> it seems like they tackled the reality of the situation really well it would make me uncomfortable to see the more racist elements but that is a part of life i hope the movie helps other people see the reasons to try and overcome issues do you have a favorite scene <end>	
<begin> yeah so many nice cars reminds me of fast and furious <end>	
<begin> who is his favorite character in the movie <end>	
<begin> now i remember jennifer aniston was also in that movie <end>	
<begin> thanks bye <end>	
<begin> that is crazy love if you cant be in love with someone then no one can <end>	
<begin> yeah i really liked the ending while it wasnt perfect it was real <end>	
<begin> it is an original concept for sure if you tend towards an appreciation for silly humor the minions have you covered they often get themselves into very rube goldberg esque shennanigans <end>	
<begin> well its a really good movie what kind of genres are you interested in <end>	
<begin> the cop knocked on the door after a scene and he opens the door and the cop is like is everything ok lol and he is like yeah it was comical <end>	
<begin> what tunes are in the soundtrack that u mentioned <end>	
<begin> sebastian character is sort of annoying i mean hes into jazz and is suppose to be this great musician but is a compete snob about it def not a likable character even towards the end really <end>	
<begin> who does he play <end>	
<begin> same here thank you also bye <end>	
<begin> the enigma machine is an important historical item <end>	
<begin> i assume that was named after christopher morcom <end>	
<begin> i mean not rated well <end>	
<begin> what do you think about the th scene <end>	
<begin> wowthat really sounds original never seen anything like that <end>	
<begin> so the guy was going to do a experiment on the cre ature and the mute lady will stop him or that isnt true <end>	
<begin> its great care to hear about the ending <end>	
<begin> yes that was instrumental to solving the mysteries of the enigma machine <end>	
<begin> it was like an existential crisis <end>	
<begin> it does but its appropriate one of the central conflicts in the film revolves around grus perception of himself as the super villian he sees himself as a despicable person however during the course of the movie you see that he actually has a very big heart <end>	
<begin> i like things i can share with my parents <end>	
<begin> its got a few things going on family well off folks adopt a poor teenager sports teens a football star how will he get into college and some social commentary about all of the above <end>	
<begin> i want to remove his nose and stuck into busters poop <end>	
<begin> did not know cant copy <end>	
<begin> its funny how the character was home schooled because her parents were zoologists working in africa no wonder she had to be educated on the clicks in the beginning of the movie <end>	
<begin> thanks you too <end>

<begin> yeah and the the users gave is <number> <number> <end>	
<begin> ahaha sorry the title was iron man my mistake ohh my <end>	
<begin> cool i have those so i will check that out <end>	
<begin> i usually dont trust those scores so much i tend to go with viewer ratings instead of critics ratings people have better tastes than critics <end>	
<begin> ultinmalety tels the people to destroy the crypto graoph machine why <end>	
<begin> i love woody hes a really sassy cowboy i loved the scene where buzz found out there were other versions of him <end>	
<begin> morgan is the man <number> on rotten tomatoes but its much better than that <end>	
<begin> possible <end>	
<begin> theres some scenes with the use of guns <end>	
<begin> due to technology <end>	
<begin> so do you think you will watch this movie <end>	
<begin> menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work so they can never tell anything about the machines <end>	
<begin> like one where the girl mia hears the boy sebastian playing the piano in a bar but he brushes her off <end>	
<begin> yes it was moving i teared up for sure <end>	
<begin> i have heard about it <end>

<begin> emma stone and ryan gosling play the leads <end>	
<begin> how about you <end>

<begin> can you tell me the name of any good movie you have seen recently <end>	
<begin> i like action comedy horror type of movies <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> well im glad it was as big as it was as the message it sent out to teenage girls hopefully got through to some because high school days are stressful enough to be worrying about why you are arent in a clique its good to be different <end>	
<begin> does he get to sing <end>	
<begin> the guy has a suit though an iron suit <end>	
<begin> ah mean girls such a funny movie have you seen it <end>

<begin> sounds like a good plan make sure you have bananas the minions like them <end>	
<begin> yeah it has a bunch of great scenes where the two dont quite connect <end>	
<begin> so it ends a bit sadly then but i guess thats how real life goes <end>	
<begin> lol hilarious you kidding me of course arguably the best of all time <end>	
<begin> no doubt the lazy part <end>	
<begin> oh wow thats a lot of great actors <end>	
<begin> do you like sci fi movies in general <end>	
<begin> she was great in her role as joan clarke <end>	
<begin> yes she did <end>	
<begin> so i guess gru is despicable <end>	
<begin> thors brother loki from subjugating earth <end>	
<begin> if we must always be attentive a question how long this study lasts <end>	
<begin> i enjoyed it one of my favored comic book adaptations <end>	
<begin> one of the things i wasnt a fan of was the fact that mia didnt really have any development <end>	
<begin> its not very often a movie gets a cinemascore a and im glad it did as it sent out a very positive message <end>	
<begin> zootopia <end>

<begin> yeah gotta organize a movie night for it popcorn etc <end>

<begin> what was the rotten tomatoes score then <end>	
<begin> hes played by quinton aaron i dont know the name do you maybe id recognize his photo <end>	
<begin> i always forget that woody had a girlfriend bopeep i heard the th movie theyre making is about <end>

<begin> how did you enjoy jim carrey movie bruce almighty <end>	
<begin> of course <end>	
<begin> do you think a good movie needs high profile actors <end>	
<begin> i think its a great movie what do you think of it <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> ahh yes <end>	
<begin> i might have to watch it to see what you mean i think failing and trying again shows real depth <end>	
<begin> also just visually beautiful <end>	
<begin> slinky dog was one my favorites too because when i was a kid i had a dachshund dog <end>	
<begin> well its a fantasy drama film <end>	
<begin> i love how it was set in wwi era as well <end>	
<begin> that sounds funny i like morgan freeman <end>	
<begin> what do you think about the key scene <end>	
<begin> yes this was based on a true story though there are certainly some artistic licenses throughout the film but the nonetheless a good watch with great acting <end>	
<begin> during this time seb feels so out of sorts the band hes in is finding success in pop music but because hes such a jazz pureist he wants to quit <end>	
<begin> yes they used it to decrypt the messages the nazis were sending <end>	
<begin> great thank you are you an animation fan <end>

<begin> how about you <end>	
<begin> i liked monsters the movie in it the monsters are under the bed but turn out to be friendly great movie to take the kids to <end>	
<begin> i think you are suppose to be asking questions <end>	
<begin> any other questions about the movie <end>	
<begin> the story line is about the life of frank abagnale leo dicaprio who is a con artist who conned millions of dollars by posing as a pan american airways pilot a georgia doctor and a louisiana parish prosecutor <end>	
<begin> hey now <end>	
<begin> what did you think of gal gadot as wonder woman <end>	
<begin> i dont agree with the fact that the document says the genre is scientific i think the movies more of a thriller <end>	
<begin> yeah it turns out being a homosexual played a big part in turings life <end>	
<begin> yes the director of it was morten tyldum <end>	
<begin> any other questions about the movie <end>	
<begin> and history also captivated me <end>	
<begin> those ppl who felt like that move wasnt funny are the same ppl who thim amy is funny <end>	
<begin> also steve carrell is the main character in the sequel evan almighty <end>	
<begin> and the cinemascore is an a <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> i didnt know that <end>	
<begin> i wasnt sure about those two to start out with they just didnt seem like theyd be good together <end>	
<begin> well i guess thats a happy ending then <end>	
<begin> what happens next <end>	
<begin> doug jones is in it too he does great creature work <end>	
<begin> yes sandra bullock is the mother and tim mcgraw is the father i didnt know he acted did you <end>	
<begin> can this study be repeated <end>	
<begin> yeah it kinda difficult to get someone into this film since everyone is whose your favorite character by the way <end>	
<begin> morgan is the man <number> on rotten tomatoes but its much better than that <end>	
<begin> angelina jolie in maleficent was amazing <end>	
<begin> dreamy <end>	
<begin> i meant <number> <end>	
<begin> that is very good <end>	
<begin> i might have can you get indeep with your favorite seen of the movie <end>	
<begin> oh really that is kind of weird i would have thought it was more of a fantasy <end>	
<begin> sally hawkins was the main actress <end>	
<begin> i would too dont blame him for worrying <end>	
<begin> yesthis rigth <end>	
<begin> oh yes caimcross was a soviet spy <end>	
<begin> yeah i agree especially about rotten tomatoes ive really enjoyed movies before that if having read the reviews beforehand would have maybe put me off resulted in me missing a good movie <end>	
<begin> which scene do you remember and like the most <end>	
<begin> great well it is a biographical crime directed by steven spielberg and starring leonardo dicaprio tom hanks christopher walken and amy adams to name a few <end>	
<begin> oh yes caimcross was a soviet spy <end>	
<begin> yesthe avengers teams are very good <end>	
<begin> i do classic hollywood is a favorite <end>	
<begin> <end>	
<begin> i agree <end>	
<begin> i saw it a few years ago again its a fun christmas movie i remember gus the polka band player was played by john candy <end>	
<begin> it say that a custodian falls in love with an amphibian creature <end>	
<begin> not at first she didnt <end>	
<begin> have you seen it <end>	
<begin> how mdid you like british cryptography moives <end>	
<begin> yes i agree its good to show it and good to make people uncomfortable so they think about it and hopefully see whats wrong i think my favorite scene is when michael questions leigh anne mother about her motives for taking him in it was an important conversation to have and not an easy one but ultimately michaels okay w what she says and it shows that hes finally feeling safe enough to have opinions about things <end>	
<begin> what do you think about the rd scene <end>	
<begin> he loves buzz lightyear <end>	
<begin> his recalibration of machine after an epiohany <end>	
<begin> wow that seems really moving honestly <end>	
<begin> if its a pretty interesting movie to hang out <end>	
<begin> don rickles is the voice of mr potato head <end>	
<begin> im not sure cat woman would fit well in this case really it pokes fun at the concept of super villains and the stereotypical crimes they often pursue gru in this movie wants to steal the moonbut is foiled by another up and coming super villain in the end he ends up giving the moon to his girlswhich is a cute stereotype of a good father <end>	
<begin> still for its limits it is improbably fun to watch due to its characters <end>	
<begin> indeed <end>	
<begin> movie name <end>	
<begin> jim carrey was the right choice with that movie <end>	
<begin> what do you think about the second scene <end>	
<begin> what do you think about this wonderful movie <end>	
<begin> the ending is really good to when he gets another dog <end>	
<begin> yesthe avengers teams are very good <end>

<begin> hello how are you i am not entirely sure about what question to ask so ill just ask do you think the critics were fair in their critique of the movie <end>	
<begin> no i had forgotten about that part entirely <end>	
<begin> i agree thats why i had to rated it an <number> <end>	
<begin> its sad that stefan drugs her and cuts her wings with iron <end>	
<begin> how mdid you like british cryptography moives <end>	
<begin> i have yet to see any of the superman movies to be honest <end>	
<begin> enjoy watching <end>	
<begin> it shows people dying on screen too <end>	
<begin> does he decide to go to college <end>	
<begin> me too <end>	
<begin> names his machine christopher <end>	
<begin> well i dont know how you feel about romantic comedies <end>	
<begin> now computers here but before nothiog could compare top it except the huiman brain <end>	
<begin> do you think a good movie needs high profile actors <end>	
<begin> one of his best movies is bruce almighty have you heard of him <end>	
<begin> it must be really cool to see a movie where the toys that you grew up with are sentient and fun characters <end>	
<begin> nooo i had him as toy so hell always be in my heart <end>	
<begin> i remember jumping in my seat because it was so startling <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> what is your initial opinion on the movie without going into depth do you like it or not <end>	
<begin> thats true maybe some people didnt like that it was a white family helping a black boy im not sure i did like when they got michael a tutor she was outspoken and nice so her personality added some fun to the goings on and seeing him become happier and feel loved while doing better at football was greatinspiring hopeful that sort of thing <end>	
<begin> i think he told her tho i cant remember <end>	
<begin> but you did not do it then because you choose it if you did not see it <end>	
<begin> in what sense where does it take place <end>	
<begin> hello you there <end>	
<begin> you have not really seen the movie <end>	
<begin> im suprised its so low <end>	
<begin> alright sounds good <end>	
<begin> yes a mysterious creature shows up one day and she is intrigued and decides to visit him and they form a close bond <end>	
<begin> it <end>	
<begin> what is the title of the movie <end>	
<begin> it can be but not always im personally not that interested in sports how heavily does that impact my ability to watch it <end>	
<begin> not familiar with him but a good movie <end>	
<begin> and they are usually pretty good about putting funny stuff for adults in them as well <end>	
<begin> by reading the last seen marley is the old neighbor guy everyone thought he was scary but kevin helped him reunited with his son and granddaghter <end>	
<begin> ok good bye <end>	
<begin> what kind of emotions <end>	
<begin> hope you enjoyed the movie from what you said i dont know to much about it ill have to check it out sometime soon <end>	
<begin> when you watched the movie what did you think about caimcross <end>	
<begin> yeah its interesting when stars in other areas cross over to new ones right <end>	
<begin> how did the avengers become divided <end>	
<begin> well they meet for a second time at a party and seb is in a <number> s cover band they have this chemistry that is ignored and they go on with their lives for a while <end>	
<begin> im not surprised did shapes of water won a oscar <end>	
<begin> the fight of the amazons when men arrive on their island <end>	
<begin> i remember jumping quite a bit during inception <end>	
<begin> i suppose its just all about personal preference my favourite american comedy films include anything with will ferrol seth rogan so more slapstick films im sure this was the movie that made lindsay lohan huge even though she had starred in m ovies from her early years <end>	
<begin> benedict cumberbatch was a great actor in the lead role <end>	
<begin> yeah cant recall any of his other movies amanda seyfried did pretty well after the mean girls though <end>	
<begin> but maleficent awakens sleeping beauty <end>	
<begin> hello there <end>	
<begin> i love that part too <end>	
<begin> oops <end>	
<begin> how do they fall in love then <end>	
<begin> i like the way he was responding the prayers by email <end>	
<begin> and woody said bo peep that was heartbreaking <end>	
<begin> oh man that sounds great who else was in it <end>	
<begin> i dont think it was anything wrong with the movie the action was awesome but i prefer other types of movies <end>	
<begin> yeah it would be nice if they came out with a pre sequel is that a prelude like showing him in his past days and his wife <end>	
<begin> she is i enjoy this section where she attempts to do a women show and i was caught up in the emotions during this scene shes such a great actress that the execution is so believable it sounds like a story of a friend of a friend <end>	
<begin> yeah more often than not teen comedies tend to be slap stick type this was a lot more cerebral i wonder if the actress who played regina did any more movies she was fantastic in the movie <end>	
<begin> he almost killed woody <end>	
<begin> some emotions <end>	
<begin> i can agree with that <end>	
<begin> also i forgot to say the storys also based on his real family the tuohys <end>	
<begin> steve carrel does some amazing voice work as the main character <end>	
<begin> hello have you seen the movie despicable me <end>	
<begin> she was amazing <end>	
<begin> yes hes quite good <end>	
<begin> out <end>	
<begin> do you like old movies <end>	
<begin> hey there how are you <end>	
<begin> i liked that by the way of the mustang stealing it gets establshed the previous story of jhon wick as a top assassin <end>	
<begin> y <end>	
<begin> yes she did she did very well the movie and the star surprised me with how good they were especailly after the mess of the superman batman movie <end>	
<begin> its still not finished <end>	
<begin> got it are there any star actor actresses in it <end>	
<begin> is it suitable movie for children <end>	
<begin> interested how the homosexual part played a role <end>	
<begin> lol now which one wade buster was he the pig <end>	
<begin> amazing hoiw technogoly has advanced <end>	
<begin> haha yes there were so many action scenes for they to clean after <end>	
<begin> what do you think the critic means by saying sadistic festival of adult bashing it would be a different perspective but i still think it would be funny dont you <end>	
<begin> i forgot about that scene now that you think about it naw i still like the guy <end>	
<begin> do they make it in the end both as a couple and in their respective careers <end>	
<begin> it is a science fiction comedy hybrid <end>	
<begin> doesnt like a cop how up too thats a friend <end>	
<begin> they must be good then <end>	
<begin> oh thats sound very interesting do they have to face any enemies in the film <end>	
<begin> yeah it won a lot of them <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> hmmm sounds a lot like those story about mermaid like creatures that our government is supposedly trying to hide <end>	
<begin> i agree <end>	
<begin> the movie <end>	
<begin> or never mind i forgot his friend chris <end>	
<begin> i mean the movie is still fresh and with so much style for a crafty revenge thriller <end>	
<begin> did you think that it was a sad part of the movie <end>	
<begin> i agree i thought the movie was funny <end>	
<begin> i think you are right that there are <number> i never saw the other <number> usually remakes are not that good <end>	
<begin> i hear you im not super into sports either theres a lot more going on that makes it a good watch michael runs away from foster care football offers a way for him to feel better about himself and life leigh annes friends question the safety of adopting him via thinly veiled racism and classism theres a bit about him becoming comfortable with his talents sound any better <end>	
<begin> he made millions calling out money forgers and also made millions creating unforgeable checks <end>	
<begin> i am a fan of comic books at various times ive read both marvel and dc although marvel does seem to make better movies <end>	
<begin> something you dont get with movies most of the time <end>	
<begin> what do you think is the best part of the scene <end>	
<begin> hi just reading about the blind side movie have you seen it <end>	
<begin> yeah it turns out being a homosexual played a big part in turings life <end>	
<begin> where are you from <end>	
<begin> i cant either she probably felt horrible funny how she fought to get a flight home and didnt want to wait but her family made it back the same exact time <end>	
<begin> so i should see bruce almighty first <end>	
<begin> awesome cast <end>	
<begin> how do they fall in love then <end>	
<begin> i really liked when everyone woke up on the plane you get so invested in the dream layers that you forget where it all started <end>	
<begin> hes an offensive lineman a big athletic guy <end>	
<begin> cool think this was based on a true story <end>	
<begin> i hated mr potato head <end>	
<begin> do you know about how long the movie is <end>	
<begin> did you see it <end>	
<begin> do you think the genre should be drama <end>	
<begin> i did not like the end of the movie though <end>	
<begin> sadly no they drift away as their careers go in different directions he misses an important play and she moves back home <end>	
<begin> i think they meant to say science fiction <end>	
<begin> ah i see who is the story based on <end>	
<begin> i have seen the movie so much i practically have it memorized <end>	
<begin> yes <end>	
<begin> it would make more sense it is from disney <end>	
<begin> california im always here watching movies <end>	
<begin> hello <end>	
<begin> i agree so many of the kids movies are so great nowadays that i enjoy watching them too <end>	
<begin> overall i like the movie it has some high profile actors what about you <end>	
<begin> got good reviews as i see from rotten tomatoes and others <end>	
<begin> some emotions <end>	
<begin> yes doing that thing without thinking any consequences <end>	
<begin> yes he got involved with christopher morcom who sparked his interest in crypto <end>	
<begin> and what is your favorite part <end>	
<begin> i can still remember the pressure of that stage in life and it was a long time ago although my daughter is nearly <number> so im trying to make sure she has the self confidence to not feel the need to follow the in crowd as the damage it can do to teenage girls can be very serious <end>
