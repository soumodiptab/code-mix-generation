<begin> hello do you like superhero movies <end>	<begin> namaste aap ko superhero movies aaccha lagega kya <end>
<begin> yes batman begins i think this a great batman film have you seen it <end>	<begin> ha batman start huwa mene socha hi ki ee batman film tho great hi aap dekha hi kya <end>
<begin> yes i have christian bale is my favorite batman so far <end>	<begin> ha mere pas hi christian bale tho mera favorite batman hi abhi tak <end>
<begin> do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them <end>	<begin> aap movies ka ratings dekega kya dekhne ke pehle <end>
<begin> i usually do but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not <end>	<begin> mene dekungi lekin rating se kuch farak nahi padega jho mene dekungi ya nahi <end>
<begin> the film has several great big name actors which is another reason i like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone <end>	<begin> ee film tho bahut great bada actors tha ee tho dusara reason hi mere kho aacha laga aur mene dekungi bina actors keliye <end>
<begin> i agree there are quite a few great actors in batman begins i like liam neeson too even though he is one of the villains <end>	<begin> ha bahut sara great actors hi batman begins me mene like karungi liam neeson tho bi vo tho eek villain be hi <end>
<begin> seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest along with super heros and villans a good rating does help me feel like i will not waste my time watching something awful <end>	<begin> utna potential hi actors me dekhke big screen mere kho bahut interest aaya tha milke dono super heros aur villans bhi hi isko aacha rating help karega mene time waste mat karungi dusara awful movie dekhke <end>
<begin> but the same time will not deter me from a film if i am just into the genre <end>	<begin> lekin same time me mene nahi deter karungi ee film se if mene just genre dekhke <end>
<begin> i personally prefer good ratings even if a movie has many good actors if its rated poorly i usually wont watch it in theaters <end>	<begin> main personally acchi ratings prefer karta hun even agar kisi movie mein kayi acche actors hain lekin agar uski rating kharab hai to main usko usually theaters mein nahi dekhta <end>
<begin> im not sure if i agree with the metacritic score of <number> though <end>	<begin> waise mein sure nahi hun ki mein metacritic ke <number> score se agree karunga <end>
<begin> the <number> on rotten tomatoes seems more accurate <end>	<begin> rotten tomatoes pe <number> zyada accurate lagta hai <end>
<begin> i will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on dvd video if the rating turn me off <end>	<begin> generally mere paas enough patience hota hai to wait for a film to be released on dvd video agar mujhe rating pasand nahi aati <end>
<begin> what did you think of the bat scene in the movie <end>	<begin> movie ke bat scene ke baare mein kya khyal hai <end>
<begin> i felt that scene shows the story of this film well and is thought out <end>	<begin> main sochta hun ki ye scene shows the story of this film well kaafi socha samjha hai <end>
<begin> i wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well though <end>	<begin> waise i wonder ki bats ke liye dry well se behtar koi place ho sakti thi kya <end>
<begin> batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out <end>	<begin> batman as a child accha step tha by the filmmaker ye dikhane ke liye ki uski life kaise start hui <end>
<begin> because this movie is called batman begins i agree that it was appropriate to show bruces beginnings <end>	<begin> because movie ka naam batman begins hai so i agree ki bruce ki shuruaati life dikhana appropriate hai <end>
<begin> i think its ironic that the muggers name is joe chill but he isnt chill if he murders people <end>	<begin> mere khyal se ye ironic hi hai ki muggers name is joe chill lekin wo chill nahi hai if he murders people <end>
<begin> unlikely yes i think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to the bats <end>	<begin> unlikely haan mujhe lagta hai wo batman kaise bana k ek mysterious beginning dikhana chahte the but phir bhi thodi mystery chhodna chahte the ke use bats ka phobia kaise hota hai <end>
<begin> very ironic mr chill is more of a bone chilling murderer <end>	<begin> bahut ironic mr chill to ek bone chilling murdered hai <end>
<begin> he is also murdered too so at least he gets what he deserves <end>	<begin> uska bhi murder hojata hai to kam se kam wo jo deserve karta hai use mil jata hai <end>
<begin> he got whats coming to him but bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge <end>	<begin> jo uske liye hona tha usko mil jata hai but brucse uska murder nahi karta to main sochta hu wo uski badla leni ki chahat rah jaati hai <end>
<begin> i think it helps to establish that bruce will not directly murder anyone even when he burns down the league of shadows he doesnt directly kill ras al ghul <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai iss ye establish hone me help hoti hai k bruce kabhi kisi ka directly murder nahi karte even jab wo league of shadows ko jala deta hai ras al ghul ko directly nahi maarta hai <end>
<begin> injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder in any case <end>	<begin> injustice kabhi bhi murder ka reason nahi hona chaiye <end>
<begin> i feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows and to purge his fear of bats this key part i think is pretty lucky break for him as he is doing jail time in a foreign country <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai ke wo lucky tha k league of shadows ka part ban gaya aur apne bats k dar ko hata diya <end>
<begin> it is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing <end>	<begin> ye kaafi strange hai k uski family butler afford kar sakti hai but wo jail chor karne k liye jata hai <end>
<begin> i really like gary oldman as gordon he plays a good cop really well <end>	<begin> mujhe gary oldman as gordon accha laga wo ek good cop accha play karta hai <end>
<begin> what did you think of the scarecrow scenes <end>	<begin> tum scarecrow wale scenes k baare me kya sochte ho <end>
<begin> the scarecrow was particularly scary character trying to poison the water supply <end>	<begin> scarecrow kafi scary character tha water supply ko poison karne ki try kar raha tha <end>
<begin> and batman was poisoned with the fear inducing drugs i thought it was over for him <end>	<begin> aur batman fear inducing drugs se poisoned tha mujhe laga uska sab over hai <end>
<begin> it appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points yeah <end>	<begin> haan puri movie mein kafi points par aisa laga ki kafi character ke liye it was over <end>
<begin> i was surprised when the real ras al ghul showed himself too the league of shadows doesnt die easily <end>	<begin> main bhi surprised tha jab asli ras al ghul ne khud ko dikhaya league of shadows asaani se nahi marta <end>
<begin> he seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences <end>	<begin> lagta hai past experience survive karne ke baad usme otherworldy power they <end>
<begin> hey <end>	<begin> aho <end>
<begin> hi <end>	<begin> hello <end>

<begin> rotten tomatoes gave it a <number> rating and average of <number> <number> yes i believe so <end>	<begin> rottten tomatoes ne ise <number> rating di he aur <number> <number> ka average ya me aisa believe karta hu <end>
<begin> okay then right ive always experiened that imdb gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes <end>	<begin> tab oke he right me hamesha experience kiya he ki rotten tomatoes ke comparison me imdb movies ko lower average rating deta he <end>
<begin> tha <end>	<begin> not he it is tha <end>
<begin> thats true <end>	<begin> ye to sure he <end>

<begin> yeah i think joss whedon was a good choice for director also his vision was really inline with the comics <end>	<begin> han mujhe lagta he ki director ke liye bhi joss whedon good choice uska vision comics ke sath vastav me inline tha <end>
<begin> well i cant speak for the comics havent read them but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories <end>	<begin> well me comics ke regarding to kah nahi sakta me unhe read nahi kiya ke but ye movies all heroes aur unki stories ka ek great mashup ke <end>

<begin> right that was a great scene <end>	<begin> haan badhiya scene tha <end>
<begin> lokis a likable villain id say <end>	<begin> main bolunga k loki ek likable villain hai <end>
<begin> it was interesting how it caused such a riff within the avengers thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie <end>	<begin> avengers me uska kaha suni karwarna kaafi interesting tha thor ko movie k doran aise lag raha tha uske liye loyalty hai <end>
<begin> you think <end>	<begin> tum ye sochte ho <end>
<begin> i thought he was pretty ruthless with him <end>	<begin> mujhe to laga wo uske saath kaafi ruthless tha <end>
<begin> thats just my opinion obviously <end>	<begin> wo bas mera opinion hai obviously <end>
<begin> i can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to <end>	<begin> main wo dekh sakta hu but mujhe lagta hai wo bahut jyada damagar kar sakta tha agar wo chahta wo <end>
<begin> do you have a specific example on mind <end>	<begin> tumhare mind me koi specific example hai <end>
<begin> the end fight scene definitely was he could have killed him <end>	<begin> wo end fight scene definitely wo use maar sakta tha <end>
<begin> oh the one where hulk ends up hitting him <end>	<begin> oh wha kha hai jise hulk maar rha hai <end>
<begin> yeah that was classic one of the funniest moments of the movie i also liked when iron man fell back through the wormhole it had everyone on edge i think <end>	<begin> ha yeh classic tha film ke sabse majedar samay mai se ek muje bhi pasand aya maine wormhole ke madhyam se vapas gir gaya muje lgta hai ki yeh har kisi ke pass tha <end>
<begin> absolutely epic scenes <end>	<begin> bilkul mahakavya ke scenes hai <end>

<begin> me too it was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways i liked how the movie expanded on the monster world <end>	<begin> muje bhi kitna inspiring hein yar isse patha chaltha hein ki hum kaise apne dreams ko accomplish karthe jo jarur sach hoga muje tho is movie ka monster world expanded bahut pasand hein <end>
<begin> yes the first movie only gave one facet of the world while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree <end>	<begin> haan first movie ne yek facet world diya hein second tho larger degree ko diya hein <end>
<begin> when i heard they were making another monsters inc movie i expected a sequel not a prequel but i ended up loving it did you see it in theatres <end>	<begin> agar voh dusra monsters inc banaye tho jarur sequel he expect karenge pequel nahi lekin end tho badiya hein aap theatres mein dekhe kya <end>

<begin> do you like mike or sulley better <end>	<begin> tuzhe mike ya sulle mai se kon pasand hai jyada <end>
<begin> oh good question i think i like mike more hes weirdly optimistic <end>	<begin> acha sawal hai mujhe mike jyada acha lagta hai wo alag hi optimistic hai <end>
<begin> how about you <end>	<begin> tuzhe kya lagta hai <end>
<begin> i like mike because hes funnier he had some of the best lines in the first movie <end>	<begin> mujhe mike pasand hai kyu ki wo bahot funny hai usme kuch behterin lines hai movie ke <end>
<begin> he is so funny <end>	<begin> voh funny hein <end>
<begin> i always liked john goodmans voice acting for sully though its perfect for a big fluffy monster <end>	<begin> muje tho hamesha goodman ka voice pasand hein big aur fluffy monster ke liye tho perfect hein <end>
<begin> the part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard <end>	<begin> first movie ka end tho is part mein hein jab voh microphone mein burps out kiya tho mera kids jor se has rahe they <end>
<begin> i agree john goodman was a great choice for sulley <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon john goodman ache choice hei sulley keliye <end>
<begin> hahah i bet <end>	<begin> haha <end>
<begin> i love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest that was pretty neat <end>	<begin> muje scare machien pasand hein voh prequel mein hein jo students ko frighten huve us contest keliye pretty neat hein <end>
<begin> yeah though i was really disappointed with sulley for cheating <end>	<begin> haan sulley ka cheating se kuch disappoint hein <end>
<begin> i was too that broke my heart i cried when that happened <end>	<begin> mein bhi mera dil tho thuth gaya mein rone lage <end>
<begin> it was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike <end>	<begin> yeh tho sach mein cruel thing hein mike keliye <end>
<begin> it seemed a little out of character for sulley but i guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving <end>	<begin> sulley keliye tho yeh little out character hein lekin conflict ke liye tho unke paas final source jarur hoga <end>
<begin> i agree it was probably my least favorite part of the movie i feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon yeh probably mera least favorite part hein is movie mien muje lagtha hein ki yeh story kuch different direction mein ja raha hein <end>
<begin> for sully to trick mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful <end>	<begin> sully ko mike ko trick karne ko soch de tho voh dar gaya kitna hurtful hein <end>
<begin> i do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though thats a good message that disney started doing with the princess and the frog <end>	<begin> muje us ending bahut pasand hein jo apne dream achieve karne ke liye itna hard se work kiya ache message heindisney ka disney tho princess and the frog se start kiya aise message dene <end>
<begin> me too i like that common thread between the two movies i think it was executed better in this though because they really did start from the very bottom of monsters inch <end>	<begin> muje bhi in dono movies ka common thread pasand hein muje lagtha yeh thoda better se executed kiya hein kyon ki bottom of monster se start kiya <end>
<begin> and it explains why theyre always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie they were once in that same position <end>	<begin> aur in mein explain kiya ki kaise voh janitors ka original moives se ache hein same position mein tho hein voh <end>
<begin> oh my gosh i didnt even realize that i have to rewatch the movie youre totally right <end>	<begin> omg muje realize hi nahi huva mein is movie ko dubara dekhna pasand karunga aap bilkul sahi hein <end>
<begin> it does show a really good message for kids to be respectful of everybody <end>	<begin> isme kids keliye ache message hein jo respectful hein sabhi keliye <end>
<begin> its a valuable message be kind and respectful to everyone dont expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life just be prepared to work your hardest <end>	<begin> in mein valuable message hein sabhi ke saath kind aur respectful hona apni credentials aur family reputation ke liye kabhi life mein lean mat hona sirf prepare se ho <end>
<begin> yes i liked that they showed sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you cant always lean on your familys reputation it can only get you so far <end>	<begin> haan muje bhi sully ka spoiled brat pehela pasand hein jo apni family reputation ke liye kabhi lean nahi hota <end>
<begin> maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition because he didnt really realize the consequences of his actions just did what he thought was right <end>	<begin> lekin uska background thoda spoiled hein kyon ki voh competition mein cheat kiy lekin unka action ka consequences nahi realize huva bas kya use right laga voh kar baita <end>
<begin> i feel like a lot of kids need that message these days <end>	<begin> i feel aajkal bahut se kids ko is meesage ki bahut jarurat hai <end>
<begin> youve got a good point there about the cheating <end>	<begin> tumhare pass bahut badhiya point hai cheating ke baare men <end>
<begin> and you have a good point there about kids needing that message <end>	<begin> aur aapke pass yah badhiya point hai is message ka kids ki jaruraton ke baare me <end>
<begin> i like that they had to work hard together too so it didnt feel like so much of a struggle because mike and sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder <end>	<begin> maine ye baat like ki ki unko sath milke hard work karna pada so aisa feel nahi aaya ki ye koi jyada struggle tha because mike and sully ko ek dusre ke sath the unka struggle share karne me jab wo corporate ladder chadh rahe the <end>

<begin> i really liked all the comedy in it and the music <end>	<begin> muje comedy pasand aaya aur uska music bhi <end>
<begin> the comedy is true to the spirit of monsters inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground the music hit all the right notes i think <end>	<begin> comedy tho true se us spirit ka monsters hein kaafi tone se match kiya jo kabhi old ground mein turn nahi hota music tho sahi notes hein <end>
<begin> i agree it was a very safe bet for pixar with how they presented it <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon yeh pixar ka safe bet hein jis tarah voh present kiye <end>
<begin> superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money though <end>	<begin> superstar actors ka voice acting karna is always going to make money though <end>
<begin> i agree it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away for a mere prequel thats a good result <end>	<begin> main agree karta hun isme kafi stuff jo cuteness ke immediate buzz ke melt hone ke baad imagination ko haunt karegi mere prequel ke liye ye acha result hai <end>
<begin> i liked the whole fraternity aspect of it very tongue in cheek <end>	<begin> mujhe iska saara fraternity aspect acha laga bohat tongue in cheek <end>
<begin> yes it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters <end>	<begin> han ye ek as a whole series pe refreshing outlook tha aur characters ke liye nice background provide karti hai <end>
<begin> i thought the scene of mike at <number> years old was a good call back too <end>	<begin> mujhe laga mike ka <number> years old ka scene bhi acha call back tha <end>
<begin> i agree i liked when they show mikes background story of why he became a scarer i always wondered why he chose to do that <end>	<begin> i agree mujhe acha laga jab unhone mike ki background story dikhayi ki wo scarer kyun ban gaya main hamesha sochta hu usne aisa karna kyun chose kia <end>
<begin> i also like how they show the friendship between mike and sully develop <end>	<begin> mujhe ye bhi acha laga ki kaise unhone mike aur sully ki friendship develop hote dikhaya <end>
<begin> yeah i never thought of sully as the cool guy iike that <end>	<begin> haan maine kabhi nahi socha sully ko is tarah cool guy <end>
<begin> i didnt know sully had such a pretentious background compared to other characters it explains why only he was accepted into roar omega roar <end>	<begin> main nahi janta sully ka baaki characters ke comparison mein itna pretentious background tha isse samajh aata hi sirf wahi kyun roar omega roar mein accept huya <end>
<begin> true and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed <end>	<begin> sach aur ye ye dikhane ka acha kaam karti hai ki dono characters flawed hain <end>
<begin> i thought the whole scare games plot was a fairly good one too kept it interesting <end>	<begin> mery khyal k mutabiq tamam khofnak game ka plot kafi achaa bhi tha bht dilchasp rakha <end>
<begin> i agree i like that they didnt try to make them perfect <end>	<begin> mai manta hun mjhy acha laga k unhun ne unko oerfect banany ki koshish nai ki <end>
<begin> yes and so much was at stake for them in that game as well <end>	<begin> han aur unky lia bht kuch us game mai dao per bhi laga hua tha <end>
<begin> it would decide if they could be renerolled or not how do you feel about how sully cheated <end>	<begin> ye faisla krega k kia wo reenrolled ho skty hain ya nai apko kaisa laga k sully ne kaisy cheat kia <end>
<begin> i thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment <end>	<begin> mery mutabiq ye anhooni ko sirf delay ker rha tha aur unhy accomplishment ki aik jhooti tasalli de rha tha <end>
<begin> i agree i felt bad for mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win <end>	<begin> mai manta hun mjhy mike k lia bura laga jo soch rha tha k wo khud se kamyaab hua jabky usy jeetny mai madad di gaye <end>
<begin> i thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team was diqualified for cheating <end>	<begin> mery khyal tha k ye ironic bhi hai qk unhy phly muqabbly mai sirf is lia nikala gaya q k dusri team ko cheating kerny per disqualify kia gaya <end>
<begin> yes i agree it ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well <end>	<begin> han ge mai manta hun iska khatma unhy university se nikalny per he hua <end>
<begin> i feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted though <end>	<begin> mjhy lagta ha k unhun ne baki tamam logon k accept hony ki waja se apni qurbani di hai <end>
<begin> i agree and i think that it was a noble thing to do at least they still were able to be hired at monsters inc and work their way up to becoming scarers <end>	<begin> mai manta hun aur mera khyal hai k ik acha kaam tha krny kokam az kam wo monsters inc mai hire hony k qabil thy aur apny apko scarer banany tak phncha skty thy <end>
<begin> yeah guess it shows that you dont need education sometime haha <end>	<begin> han guess ye dikhata hai ki sometimes tumhe education nahi chahiye haha <end>
<begin> exactly sometimes all thats needed is preservation and hardwork <end>	<begin> exactly kabhi kabhi sirf preservation aur hardwork hi needed hota hai <end>
<begin> at least they didnt get in a lot of trouble with the cda <end>	<begin> kam se kam ye cda ke saath zyada trouble mein nahi pade <end>
<begin> yeah i was taken aback when hardscrabble said they were the first students to surprise her <end>	<begin> han i was taken aback jab hardscrabble ne bola wo usey surprise karne wale first students they <end>
<begin> i agree i thought they werent too special all in all it was a great movie <end>	<begin> i agree mujhe laga ye zyada special nahi tha all in all ye great movie thi <end>

<begin> i disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring i really found the entire movie to be enthralling <end>	<begin> mein unn do reviews se asahmat hu jinhone likha tha ki film dull hai aur beech ka part boring hai mujhe sach mein poori film enthralling lagi <end>
<begin> yep i agree with you i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack since theyre not singers <end>	<begin> han mein aapse sehmat hu mein ye maanta hu ki humko emma stone aur ryan gosling ko kuch slack kaatna chahiye kyuki wo singers nahi hain <end>
<begin> agreed i really liked the scene where sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing christmas music only <end>	<begin> han meine mana mujhe wah scene bohat achha laga jahan sebastian jazz music improv karta hai jabki usko sirf christmas music play karna chahiye <end>
<begin> it was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after i watched the movie <end>	<begin> ye unmein se ek scene tha jo film dekhne k baad bhi mere sath chipka reh gaya <end>
<begin> would you do that if you were in his position <end>	<begin> tum kya karte agar tum uski position mein hote <end>
<begin> im not sure i liked how that was when mia first heard sebastian sing and was truly moved by it i think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship <end>	<begin> mujhe sure nahi hu mujhe yah pasand aaya ki jab mia ne pehli baar sebastian ko gaate huye suna aur wo sach mein uss se move ho gayi mujhe lagta hai ye unki relationship ko start karne a interesting way tha <end>
<begin> yeah it was just sad how he brushed her off since things couldve been different <end>	<begin> han ye sad tha ki usne usko brush off kar dia warna baatein kuch alag hi hoti <end>
<begin> i do like how the next time mia sees sebastian he is also singing i also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing <end>	<begin> mujhe ye achha laga ki jab next time mia ne sebastian ko dekha wo bhi gana ga raha hai mujhe ye bhi pasand aaya ki usne usko ek aisa gana request karke chidhaya kyuki usko pata tha ki usko wo gana gana achha nahi lagega <end>
<begin> do you usually watch musicals <end>	<begin> tum usually musicals dekhte ho <end>
<begin> occasionally i also enjoyed the development of sebastian and mias relationship such as when mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her i feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship <end>	<begin> kabhi kabhi mujhe bhi sebastian aur mia ki relationship ka development achha laga jaise jab mia decide karti hai ki ab wo akele hi play karegi kyuki sebastian ne usko aisa suggest kia mujhe laga ki wo dono bohat grow karte hain as individuals jab wo relationship mein aa jate hain <end>
<begin> i enjoyed that part too since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams <end>	<begin> maine woh part bhi enjoy kiya kyon ki yeh dikhata hai kitna hard ye donon kaam kar rahen hain apne dreams achieve karne ke liye <end>
<begin> they both want to become successful in their separate areas but they have to struggle a lot <end>	<begin> donon chahte hain ki successful banen apne seperate ares mein lekin bahut struggle karna padega <end>
<begin> right i feel like the review that mentions the cruelty thats involved in following your dreams really sums it up the film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big <end>	<begin> right lagta hai review jo cruelty ko mention karta hai dreams ko follow karten hai sum karta haifilm afraid nahin karta hai ki kitna hard work aur hardship involve karta hai bada hasil karne ke liye <end>
<begin> i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keiths offer <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi laga ki sebastian keo keith ka offer difficult laga <end>
<begin> i mean he gets paid but its not something he wants to do this happens in life a lot <end>	<begin> mera matlab hai use payment milta hai lekin woh hai nahin karna chahta hai ye bahut hota hai life mein <end>
<begin> i agree it must be hard to do something youre not passionate about especially when its something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams <end>	<begin> main agree karta hoon hard lagta hoga kuch karne kojab tum passionate nahin hoge especially jab tumhe kuch karna hoga tumhe ek din live karna hai dreams ke liye <end>
<begin> what did you think of the scene when mia and sebastian get into a fight about mia thinking sebastian is giving up on his dreams <end>	<begin> kya laga tumhe woh scene jab mia or sebastian fight karne lage jo mia soch rahi thi sebastian drams ko chod raha hai <end>
<begin> it was definitely well acted and i sympathize with both of them <end>	<begin> usme ekdum acchi acting thi lekin sympathize karta hoon donon se <end>
<begin> but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai sebastian harsh tha jab usne mia se kaha ki woh use aur pasand karta tha jab woh unsucessful tha <end>
<begin> it truly was heartbreaking when mia moved back home to nevada <end>	<begin> truly woh heartbreaking thi jab mia vapas nevada ghar mein gayi <end>
<begin> i feel he didnt want to hear the truth because he was really giving up on his dreams <end>	<begin> muje lagtha hein ki voh sach jaan ne mein hiskis hein kyon ki voh apna dream ko give up karta hein <end>
<begin> it really was sad <end>	<begin> voh toh bura huva <end>
<begin> i agree it was also a very unpredictable plot twist i did not see it coming at all <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon voh toh unpredictable plot twist tha muje toh patha hi nahi chala ki voh aap raha hein <end>
<begin> would you say that was the low point in the movie <end>	<begin> kya tuje aisa laga ki voh low point ka movie hein <end>
<begin> yes but i wouldnt say any part of the movie sagged badly as one review claims <end>	<begin> haan lakin muje lag raha hai ki koi sagged badly ko review karega <end>
<begin> i agree overall i would recommend the movie to a friend <end>	<begin> haan maantha hoon overall mein toh apni friend ko is movie ko recommend karunga <end>
<begin> i agree as another review points out it was a genuinely romantic comedy which i completely agree with because i feel as though sebastian and mias relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies i appreciated the realness of their relationship <end>	<begin> mein bhi toh dusra review point mein toh voh genuinely romantic comedy bola tha jo mein completely agree karunga kyon ki muje lagtha hei ki sebastian aur mia ka relationship toh cliche nahi hein jo love stories mein huva hota hein lakin voh relationship toh mein realness se appreciate karunga <end>
<begin> yes that was one thing i loved about the movie while it was sad it was not a cliche ending <end>	<begin> haan yehi toh muje is movie se pasand aaya voh toh sad tha lakin cliche ending bana <end>
<begin> i agree i think damien chazelle really did a good job directing the film <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon muje lagtha ki damien chazelle ne is film ko ache directing ki <end>
<begin> im curious are you an ai <end>	<begin> mein toh curious hoon aap <end>
<begin> if so i was completely fooled <end>	<begin> agar aisa hai to mujhe poori tarah se fool bnaya gaya <end>
<begin> i am not <end>	<begin> main nahi hu <end>
<begin> but i really was surprised that someone reviewed sebastian as a jazz snob because i did not get that vibe at all <end>	<begin> lakin main bilkul surprise hu ki kisi ne sebastian ko as a jazz snob reviewed kiya kyun ki mujhe wo vibe bilkul bhi nahi mili <end>
<begin> yeah i disagreed with that characterization but i can see why someone might say that <end>	<begin> haan main disagree hu us characterization ke stah lakin main dekh saktu hu kyun kuch log aisa keh sakte hai <end>
<begin> he is a purist or whatever they called it in the film <end>	<begin> wo ek purist hai ya phir jo kuch bhi unhone use film main bulaya <end>
<begin> i also really didnt think mias character lacked depth i think she was a rather round character especially with the large amount of independence she possessed it took a lot of courage for her to move back to nevada <end>	<begin> mujuhe bhi aisa nahi lagta ki mia ka character depth main lack karta hai mujhe lagta hai balki wo round character thi especially usne large amount of independence ke sath usne possessed kiya use bahut zada courage lagi hogi wapas neveda ke main wapas jane ke liye <end>
<begin> yes i thought her character was pretty nuanced but im not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada after the play didnt go well i think that was her only option <end>	<begin> hann mujhe lagta hai ki uska character pretty nuanced tha lakin main sure nahi hu ki ye uke liye courageous hai wapas nevada move hona play ke sahi na jane ke baad mujhe lagta hai uske paas keval yahi option tha <end>
<begin> about it <end>	<begin> iske bare main <end>
<begin> i suppose you have a point i just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didnt cling on to sebastian when things didnt work out for her <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai ki apke paas pont hai mian sochta hu ki wo zada independent thi average woman se jaisa ki film main portray kiya gaya kyunki jab chieze uske liye work out nahi ki wo sebastian ke upar chipki nahi <end>
<begin> although i wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams <end>	<begin> halaki main wish karta hu ki vain apne dreams ko achieve karne se pehle reconcile kare <end>
<begin> the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad <end>	<begin> end me jo dikhaya ki actually me kya ban sakta hai usse maine kafi sad feel kiya <end>
<begin> i agree it was very sad but also as one reviewer puts it quite bittersweet i wasnt sure how to feel at the end <end>	<begin> i agree yah bahut sad tha but also ek reviewer ne jaise bataya ki yah quite bittersweet ha mai sure hi nahi tha ki ant me mai kya feel karu <end>
<begin> it was nice discussing the film with you have a great day <end>	<begin> aapke sath film discuss karke achcha laga hava a great day <end>

<begin> its the first movie like this with batman and superman together <end>	<begin> yeh batman aur superman ki sathme aisi pehli movie hai <end>
<begin> that sounds good <end>	<begin> sunkar achha laga <end>
<begin> batman is played by ben affleck he gets tricked into fighting superman <end>	<begin> batman ka role ben affleck ne nibhaya hai use superman ke sathme ladai karne ka trick milka hai <end>
<begin> who plays superman <end>	<begin> superman ka role kisne nibhata hai <end>

<begin> it didnt get very good critics scores <end>	<begin> ishe bahut acha critic score nahi mile <end>
<begin> that is a long movie i enjoy long movies especially in the theaters it sounds interesting what did the critics have to say about it <end>	<begin> yah yek lambi moive hai muje lambi moive pasand hai khaskar theater me iski sounds majedar haikritic ne iske bare me kya kaha <end>
<begin> cinemascore graded it as a b rotten tomatoes <number> <number> and metacritic score was <number> one of the critics said it wasnt as good as dark knight but it was better than man of stee <end>	<begin> cinema score ne ishe b grad diyarotten tomatoes ne <number> <number> aur metacritic ne <number> yek critic ne khayah ki ye dark night jaisi achi nahi par man of steel se achi hai <end>
<begin> steel <end>	<begin> istel <end>

<begin> and what happens once his mom is released <end>	<begin> aur phir uski mom release hone k baad kya hoga <end>
<begin> she isnt released that way because batman realizes right before he kills superman that they are both being tricked batman ends up rescuing supermans mom and superman goes after the kidnapper <end>	<begin> wo waise release nahi hoti hai kyuki batman superman ko maarne se theek pahle samjh jata hai k dono ko trick kiya gaya hai batman superman ki mom ko bachata hai aur superman kidnapper k peeche jata hai <end>
<begin> does superman have a fight with kidnapper <end>	<begin> kya superman kidnapper k sath ladta hai <end>

<begin> luthor gets arrested and then batman goes to visit him in prison i dont want to tell you the outcome of the fight because i dont want to ruin the ending no wonder woman doesnt have a very big part <end>	<begin> luthor arrest hojata hai phir batman usse visit karne jail me jata hai main tumhe fight ka outcome nahi batana chahta kyuki main ending ruin nahi karna chahta no wonder woman ka bahut bada part nahi hai <end>
<begin> i love wonder woman yes dont give away the outcome because i want to see it <end>	<begin> mujhe wonder woman bahut pasand hai haan outcome mat batao kyuki mujhe ye movie dekhni hai <end>

<begin> yeah ive seen it its directed by christopher nolan if youve heard of him <end>	<begin> yeah maine dekhi hai ise christopher nolan ne direct kiya hai agar tumne unke bare me suna ho <end>
<begin> i think he also directed the dark knight among other things <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai unhone the dark kninght ko bhi dusri chhejo ke saath direct kiya hai <end>
<begin> inception also has a rotten tomatoes score of <number> which is really high <end>	<begin> inception ka bhi rotten tomatoes par score <number> hai jo ki kafi high hai <end>
<begin> i love his movies his a pretty good director what about the cast of the movie <end>	<begin> mujhe unki moives pasand hai wo pretty good director hai is movie ke cast ke baare me kya hai <end>

<begin> yeah pretty good actors <end>	<begin> yeah kafi acche actors <end>
<begin> i like their movies as well <end>	<begin> mujhe unki bhi moives pasand hai <end>
<begin> sounds like a good combination <end>	<begin> ye ek accha combination sound hota hai <end>

<begin> imdb rates it <number> <number> <end>	<begin> imdb rating me <number> <number> aatha hai <end>
<begin> which is also pretty high i think <end>	<begin> woh bahut achha hai mujhe eisa lagtha hai <end>
<begin> do you want to know more of the plot or a scene <end>	<begin> aap kiske bare me jan na chahthe ho plot or drshya <end>
<begin> yeah it seems like a high rating what was your favorite scene <end>	<begin> lagtha hai is ka rating achha high aap ka pasandeeda drshya kaun si hai <end>
<begin> so theres this scene where multiple people are going into a dream so they need to have someone kick them awake at the same time to escape however someone gets wounded in the dream and are almost dying and they get sent into limbo <end>	<begin> scene me bahut sare aadmi swapn me kho jaath hai koi unko jagane aur bachane ki zaroorat hai par koi log swapn me ghaayal ho gaye aur marnevale the aur limbo ho jaathe hai <end>
<begin> and what happens if the die in the dream what are the consequences of this <end>	<begin> kya hoga agar woh swapn me mar jaathe hai tho uska natheeja kya hoga <end>
<begin> they basically are stuck there until someone can wake them up in the real world so in the movie even though it was only a few hours of real time two of the characters spent fifty years in the limbo world where they had to construct it based on their shared memories <end>	<begin> woh fass jaathe hai jab tak unhe koi nai jaga tha aur duniya me le aathais movie me bale asli duniya kuch ghante ke liye hai par do character pachas saal limbo duniya me tha gayee yaadon par banan pada <end>
<begin> and whats the role of leonardo di caprio in this film <end>	<begin> leonardo di caprio ka is film me kya role hai <end>
<begin> im guessing he has the leading role <end>	<begin> mujhe lagtha hai achhi role hai <end>
<begin> yeah hes the lead actor his name is dom cobb and he specializes in conning secrets from victims in their dreams <end>	<begin> haan woh lead actor hai uska naam hai dom cobb aur uska specialization hai conning secrets from victims unke dreams mein <end>
<begin> one more thing about the limbo world is that eventually people forget that the world they are in is not real <end>	<begin> limbo world ke baare mein ek aur cheez hai ki eventually log bhool jaate hain ki jis duniye mein wo hain wo real nahi hai <end>
<begin> so they cant distinguish between a dream and what is real <end>	<begin> to wo dream aur real ke beech mein distinguish nahi kar sakte <end>
<begin> even when they wake up in a dream they are still in the dream even if they dont realize it <end>	<begin> even agar woh dream mein wake up bhi ho jaate hain to bhi wo dream mein hi hote hain even if they dont realize it <end>
<begin> seems like a really interesting concept <end>	<begin> really interesting concept lagta hai <end>

<begin> do you typically watch movies like monsters university <end>	<begin> tho aap typically monster university movie ke tarah dekhte hein <end>
<begin> typically no since i generally like to watch anime but if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid then i usually will make a effort to see it <end>	<begin> typically nahi yar kyon ki muje anime ko dekhna pasand hein jab mein kid tha jab franchise kar letha baaki tho mein effort kartha usse dekhne pe <end>
<begin> and i agree those scores kinda seem rather low <end>	<begin> haan aur unka scores tho low thi rehatha <end>
<begin> i understand just by glancing at the ratings do you think youd make an effort to go see the prequel or would the score discourage you from seeing the film <end>	<begin> mein understand kartha hoon lekin ratings tho just glancing hein tho aap prequel ka dekhne ka effort karenge ya score ka discourage aap is film nahi dekhenge <end>
<begin> id still see it despite bad reviews i generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not like if <number> of people say its bad or good i usually wont follow what i hear i just go and experience it for myself and then from there i usually say its cool or say its bad <end>	<begin> mein still is bad reviews ko despite kartha mein apne aap ko decide kartha muje pasand hein ya nahi <number> people tho ache ya bura hi bolte jo mein usually follow nahi kartha mein apne aap jaatha aur experience kartha fir mein usually acha ya bad kahatha <end>
<begin> makes sense i typically only pay attention to the ratings when its a director who i am familiar with if i know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings i usually will wait to hear from friends family before paying to see it <end>	<begin> make sence mein typically ratings par attention kartha koun director familiar aisa lekin agar mein phenomenal ka work dekhe tho particular movie tho awful rating hei mein usually family aur friends ke review suntha hoon <end>
<begin> also im a fan of comedy movies so ill probably enjoy for the memes and jokes <end>	<begin> mein bhi comedy movies ka fan hoon probably muje memes aur jokes ko enjoy kartha <end>

<begin> looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities <end>	<begin> lagtha hein ki movie thoda heavily cartoon fraternities hoga <end>
<begin> yep <end>	<begin> yap <end>
<begin> i find it odd that pixar has a scene in this movie where sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores doesnt really promote the whole fair play imagine to their age demographic <end>	<begin> muje odd laga is movie mein pixar ke liye yek scene hein waha sulley tampers ka machine badiya score hein us age demographic ke liye tho really fair play nahi promote kartha <end>
<begin> oozma kappa i cant believe they threw a kappa meme in there <end>	<begin> oozma kappa muje yakin hi nahi aatha ki voh kaapa ko meme banaye <end>

<begin> idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough <end>	<begin> kuch scary tarah ho sakthe hein <end>

<begin> yeah probably <end>	<begin> haan <end>
<begin> well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids <end>	<begin> kids keliye tho yeh safe movie sound kartha <end>
<begin> no i dont think its to make sure theyre scary enough the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university <end>	<begin> nahi muje nahi lagtha ki yeh itna bhi scary hein voh cda tho campus se nikhalne vaale the kyon ki university ka expulsion ho raha tha <end>
<begin> although i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there <end>	<begin> although mein tho expect kar rahi thi ki koi hidden adult jokes jo college mein hota tha aur fraternity tho muje yek ya do slip karne ke liye think karaya <end>
<begin> ah i see that would make sense <end>	<begin> ah ab kuch sense huva <end>
<begin> i agree i was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesnt coincide with a kids film and what youd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monsters actions <end>	<begin> mein maantha mein tho is movie ka cheating portion ko skeptical laga lekin kids film ke liye tho coincide nahi hein aur is age mein aap kya kids ko teach karenge lekin is monster action tho thoda negative reinforcers hein <end>
<begin> true movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them <end>	<begin> sach aaj kal ka movies tho formulaic tropes aur kids ke pickup se he banate <end>
<begin> i hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable <end>	<begin> i hope ki movie fresh se stays karthe aur thoda unpredictable bhi hein <end>
<begin> keep the kids on their toes <end>	<begin> kids ko apne toes ke saath hi rakhna chahiye <end>

<begin> a <number> on a kids movie doesnt seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes <end>	<begin> mera opinion se <number> kids movie tho itna bad nahi rahatha us key scenes ke read karne ke baath <end>
<begin> thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good and still seem better than movies today <end>	<begin> isliye past pixar film mera opinion se ache hein still aajkal ka movies se better hein <end>

<begin> i see it sounds like a movie that has a well developed story line <end>	<begin> i see yah to us movie ki tarah sound kar raha hai jiska ek well developed story line hai <end>
<begin> it was a very good kids movie <end>	<begin> yah kids ki lye badhiya movie thi <end>

<begin> they become crazy animals again <end>	<begin> wo fir se crazy animals ban gaye <end>
<begin> but this is all while they still think judy is a small cop <end>	<begin> but ye sab tab bhi hai jab unhe laga thai ki judy small cop hai <end>
<begin> so they still dont consider her a strong animal <end>	<begin> so wo abhi bhi use strong animal nahi consider karte <end>
<begin> i see interesting hope she gets more respect later with all the arrests <end>	<begin> i see interesting hope baki arrests ke baad use or jyada respect mile <end>

<begin> the all star cast really helped too <end>	<begin> all star cast ne bhi help ki hai <end>
<begin> not sure you could do a movie better than this one for this style <end>	<begin> main sure nahi hu is style k liye koi iss movie se better kar sakta hai <end>
<begin> yeahbut previous super hero acting is very well and adorable <end>	<begin> haanlekin pichhale supar heero ka abhinay bahut achchha aur manamohak hai <end>
<begin> well all depends on the movie <end>	<begin> achchhee tarah se sabhee philm par nirbhar karata hai <end>
<begin> this movie also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk right <end>	<begin> ho sakata hai ki is philm ne bhee halk ko sahee kaam karane mein behatar kaam kiya ho <end>
<begin> yeshulk act is marvelous in this movie <end>	<begin> haanhulk act is philm mein adbhut hai <end>

<begin> overall just a really good display of the characters <end>	<begin> kul milaakar paatron ka vaastav mein achchha pradarshan <end>

<begin> yeahwhen you watch this movie <end>	<begin> yeah tumne kab dekhi ye movie <end>
<begin> what do you think of gal gadot as wonder woman <end>	<begin> gal gadot ek wonder woman he kya sochte ho <end>
<begin> i do too <end>	<begin> mai bhi karta hu <end>
<begin> i was very impressed with both of them what about frozen <end>	<begin> mai dono se bahut impress hua aur frozen ke baare me <end>
<begin> i thought they actually did a very good job bringing the story to life in a different way <end>	<begin> actually mujhe lagta haiki unhone life ki story ko ek different way me lake bahut badhiya job kiya hai <end>
<begin> yeah i couldnt agree more with you <end>	<begin> yes mai tumse is jyada agree nahi ho sakta <end>
<begin> did you have any favorite parts characters <end>	<begin> tumhara koi favorite part characters <end>
<begin> disney does a impressive job with animated movies <end>	<begin> animated movies ke saath disney ka job bahut impressive hai <end>
<begin> they really do its amazing how much detail they put into them <end>	<begin> wo really karte hai itni saari details usme dena bahut amazing hai <end>
<begin> jonathan gross as kristoff was my favorite character <end>	<begin> jonathan gross ka kristoff ka character mera favorite hai <end>
<begin> how about yours <end>	<begin> tumhare bare me kya <end>
<begin> even though he didnt have a voice i liked sven i love how disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story along <end>	<begin> even thoough sven ki voice nahi thi par mujhe pasand hai mujhe achcha lagta hai disney kaise bina voice ke character ko film me lekar bhi kahani move karta hai <end>
<begin> yeah its impressive how they can give a character lots of personality without even having a voice <end>	<begin> haan isake prabhaavashaalee ve kaise ek aavaaj ke bina bhee ek vyaktitv ke bahut saare charitr de sakate hain <end>
<begin> i can only wish i was that talented as an artist i am more the stick figure type of artist <end>	<begin> main keval yah chaah sakata hoon ki main ek kalaakaar ke roop mein pratibhaashaalee hoon main kalaakaar ka stik phigar adhik hoon <end>
<begin> thats about as much talent as i have when it comes to art as well haha <end>	<begin> mere paas jitanee pratibha hai utanee hee kala ke baare mein bhee hai <end>
<begin> my kids laugh at me all the time about it <end>	<begin> mere bachche mere baare mein har samay hansate rahate hain <end>
<begin> from what im reading they created a frozen broadway show that would be great to take your kids to <end>	<begin> main jo padh raha hoon usase unhonne phrojan brodave sho banaaya yah aapake bachchon ko lene ke lie bahut achchha hoga <end>
<begin> hello are you there <end>	<begin> namaste kya aap vahaan hain <end>
<begin> yes <end>	<begin> haan <end>
<begin> is this the same person ive been talking to <end>	<begin> kya yah vahee vyakti hai jo baat kar raha hai <end>
<begin> are you still around <end>	<begin> kya aap abhee bhee aasapaas hain <end>
<begin> yep still here <end>	<begin> abhee bhee yahaan haan <end>
<begin> did you get the new document <end>	<begin> kya aapako naya dastaavez mila hai <end>
<begin> i would be curious to see if htey come out with another frozen <end>	<begin> mujhe yah dekhane ke lie utsuk hona chaahie ki kya hetee ek aur jame hue ke saath baahar aate hain <end>
<begin> usually sequels can be disappointing but that doesnt seem to be the case with animated movies <end>	<begin> aamataur par seekval niraashaajanak ho sakate hain lekin yah enimeted philmon ke maamale mein nahin lagata hai <end>
<begin> i think it could be really successful especially as there has been a good break in time since the first one came out <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki yah vaastav mein saphal ho sakata hai khaasakar jab se pahalee baar baahar aane se samay mein ek achchha brek aaya hai <end>
<begin> it is interesting that disney was able to add onto the history of works such as beauty and the beast <end>	<begin> yah dilachasp hai ki dijnee saundary aur jaanavar jaise kaaryon ke itihaas mein jodane mein saksham tha <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>
<begin> have you seen the movie frozen <end>	<begin> kya aapane philm phrojan dekhee hai <end>
<begin> yes i have i actually saw it in theatres with my fiance at the time it came out <end>	<begin> haan mere paas hai main vaastav mein ise apane mangetar ke saath sinemaagharon mein dekha tha jab yah baahar aaya tha <end>
<begin> did you like it <end>	<begin> kya aapako yah pasand aaya <end>
<begin> yes it is a funny animation film <end>	<begin> jee haan yah ek phanee enimeshan philm hai <end>
<begin> i agree i saw it in theaters too <end>	<begin> main sahamat hoon mainne ise sinemaagharon mein bhee dekha <end>
<begin> i enjoy almost anything that disney produces <end>	<begin> mujhe lagabhag kuchh bhee pasand hai jo dijnee paida karata hai <end>
<begin> the critical response was pretty good i see <end>	<begin> aalochanaatmak pratikriya mujhe bahut achchhee lagee <end>
<begin> i heard they are making a second movie to follow frozen <end>	<begin> mainne suna ki ve phrojan pholo karane ke lie doosaree philm bana rahe hain <end>
<begin> it only got an <number> percent on rotten tomatoes i thought it would get a higher score <end>	<begin> sade hue tamaataron par ise keval <number> pratishat mila mainne socha tha ki yah ek uchch ank praapt karega <end>
<begin> i dont much care for review sites i would rather watch a movie and judge it myself <end>	<begin> main saiton kee sameeksha karane ke lie bahut paravaah nahin karata main ek philm dekhoonga aur ise khud jaj karoonga <end>
<begin> i agree with the cinemascore of a <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon ki us cinema ka score a hein <end>
<begin> me too i love the artwork and time that goes into animation and cg movies <end>	<begin> mein bhi muje voh artwork aur uska timing animation aur cg work ka movies bahut pasand hein <end>
<begin> it seems like this movie just came out i cannot believe it was <number> when it arrived in theaters <end>	<begin> lagtha hein ki abhi hi us movie ko release huva muje yakin hi nahi hota ki voh <number> mein aaya hoga jab theaters mein <end>
<begin> yeah so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as toys shows and other items <end>	<begin> haan yar jyada attention aur populatity us stores ke toys shows aur jyada items mein ab tak jinda rakh rahe hein <end>
<begin> who is your favorite character in frozen <end>	<begin> frozen mein aapka favorite character kon hein <end>
<begin> it either has to be sven or christophe <end>	<begin> muje toh sven ya christophe pasand hein <end>
<begin> kristoff <end>	<begin> kristoff <end>
<begin> do you know who kristen bell is <end>	<begin> aapko kristen bell patha nahi hein kya <end>
<begin> i know of her but not familiar of her other acting jobs <end>	<begin> patha hein lekin jyada familiar nahi hein jaise other acting jobs ke swar <end>
<begin> i like the villain i thought he was funny <end>	<begin> muje toh voh villain pasand hein voh jyada funny lag rahe the <end>
<begin> yeah something was up when they fell for each other early in the movie between him and anna <end>	<begin> yeahuske aur anna ke bich movie se pehle kuch hua <end>
<begin> olaf could be a bit much sometimes but had some funny parts <end>	<begin> olaf thoda aur hona chahiyepar thoda funny part bhi <end>
<begin> yeah i did not even guess he would have been a bad guy <end>	<begin> yeahmene socha nahi tha wo bad ladka hoga <end>
<begin> i think i called it during the movie and said something to my fiance about how redheads are always portrayed as badguys <end>	<begin> mene socha mene use movie ke dauran bulaya and finance ke bare me kuch kaha kaise redheads are always portrayes as badguys <end>
<begin> good point i didnt even think of that <end>	<begin> achha pointmene socha bhi nahi tha <end>
<begin> he looks like the villian commander from the newer star wars movies <end>	<begin> naye star wars movie me wo villian commander ke jesa dikh raha tha <end>
<begin> what rating would you give the movie out of ten <end>	<begin> das me se kitne rating donge movie ko <end>
<begin> i think an <number> it was a great movie even if the music is overplayed <end>	<begin> nine accha movie tha music jyada play hone ke bad bhi <end>
<begin> bye <end>	<begin> aavjo <end>
<begin> what is your opinion on the movie jaws <end>	<begin> philm joz par aapakee kya raay hai <end>
<begin> to be honest i find shark movies to be terrifying <end>	<begin> sach kahoon to mujhe shaark philmen bhayaanak lagatee hain <end>
<begin> i cant say i blame you the movie definitely makes that fear worse <end>	<begin> main yah nahin kah sakata ki main tumhen dosh deta hoon philm nishchit roop se us dar ko badatar bana detee hai <end>
<begin> did you know that this film was based on a book <end>	<begin> kya tumhe pata hai ki ye film ek book par based hai <end>
<begin> no i didnt not surprised though most movies tend to be <end>	<begin> nahi maine nahi lekin mein surprise nahi hun zyadatar movies mein aisa hi hota hai <end>
<begin> i do love the jaws music though <end>	<begin> lekin jaws ka music mujhe pasand hai <end>
<begin> agreed it heightens the tension and makes it scarier but thats kind of the point <end>	<begin> agreed ye tension ko badhata hai aur isko aur daravana banata hai lekin shayad uska wahi point hai <end>
<begin> are you surprised at how high the rating is for the films critic score and if i heard the music while driving i would think someone was coming to take me out haha <end>	<begin> kya aap surprised hain ki is film ki critic score rating itni high hai aur agar mein iska music driving karte samay sunoon to mujhe lagega ki koi mujhe maarne aa raha hai haha <end>
<begin> <number> is incredibly high i would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere <end>	<begin> <number> bahut zyada high hai mujhe laga ki kam se kam kuch log to low scores denge <end>
<begin> do you agree that its a cheerfully perverse scare movie <end>	<begin> kya aap sehmat hai ki ye cheerfully perverse daravani movie hai <end>
<begin> thats what i thought as well maybe its because it was never done before in its time and was so different when it came out it might be easier to give it a pass and i would say it could be cheerfully perverse depending on the kind of movies you enjoy <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai shayad isliye kyunki us zamane mein aisa pehle nahi hua tha aur jo nikal ke aaya wo kafi alag tha usko give it a pass dena easier hoga aur mein kahunga ki ye cheerfully perverse depending on aap kaisi movies pasand karte hain <end>
<begin> do you think that it is too gruesome for children <end>	<begin> kya aapko lagta hai ki it is too gruesome for children <end>
<begin> for small children yes i could see them having nightmares <end>	<begin> chhote bacchon ke liye haan unko nightmares aa sakte hain <end>
<begin> i definitely agree with that i do find it odd that it is considered a thriller film <end>	<begin> main definitely isase agree karta hoon mujhe yah ajeeb lagata hai ki ise ek thriller film maana jaata hai <end>
<begin> i think its interesting that in the key scenes it describes the economic impact on a beach town of the shark attacks makes you wonder if theyd cover something like that up to make more money in real life <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki yah interesting hai ki key scenes mein yah shark attacks ke ek beach town pareconomic impact ka baare main batata hai aapako aashchary hota hai ki kya ve real life mein adhik paisa banaane ke lie aisa kuchh cover karenge <end>
<begin> in todays society i think that would absolutely be the case even if there was a bounty hunter hired they would probably go nothing to see here have fun <end>	<begin> aaj ke society mein mujhe lagata hai ki aisa hee hoga yahaan tak ki agar ek bounty hunter ko kaam par rakha gaya tha to ve shaayad bolengain yahaan dekhane ke lie kuchh bhee nahin hai maze karo <end>
<begin> i find it interesting that they put it in a fictional new england resort town you would think they wouldve picked somewhere in california since theres so many beaches and how huge it is <end>	<begin> mujhe yah interesting lagata hai ki unhonne ise fictional new england resort town mein rakha tha aapako lagata hai ki ve californiamein kaheen aur le gae hote kyonki vahaan bahut saare beaches hain aur yah kitana vishaal hai <end>
<begin> agreed there typically arent many shark attacks in new england usually further south or on the west coast <end>	<begin> main ye maanta hoon ki aamataur par new england mein bahut saare shark attacks nahin hote hain aamataur par south mein ya west coast par <end>
<begin> i cant imagine i would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead <end>	<begin> main imagine nahin kar sakata ki main ek tourist ke roop mein beacht par jata rahoongan agar bahut saare log marate hue paaye jate rahein <end>
<begin> i agree the movie is kind of silly the more you think about it especially when people keep believing the town and beach team that everything is fine yet people keep dying i guess they want you to suspend disbelief haha <end>	<begin> main agree karta hoon movie ek tarah se silly hai jitana bhi aap isake baare mein sochate hain khaasakar jab log shahar aur beach team par vishvaas karate rahate ki sab kuchh theek haiphir bhee log marate rahate hain mujhe lagata hai ki ve chaahate hain ki aap disbelief ko suspend karen hah <end>
<begin> or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money <end>	<begin> ya aapako lagata hai ki tourists paisa banaane ke lie bounty mein shaamil honge <end>
<begin> i wasnt aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the shore <end>	<begin> mujhe pata nahin tha ki kinaare ke paas itane saare different type ke sharks the <end>
<begin> the key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white <end>	<begin> key scenes main tiger shark aur ek great white donon ka varnan kiya gaya hai <end>
<begin> i wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open hes far to adamant about keeping them open and i always thought tiger sharks were smaller <end>	<begin> main soch raha tha ki mayor sheher mein kahin paise leta hai ya beach ke khulne pe woh beach kholne par bohot adamant tha aur mujhe humesha lagta tha ki tiger sharks chotti hoti hain <end>
<begin> i always think of great whites as the huge jaws sharks <end>	<begin> maine great whites ko humesha unn badi jaws sharks ki tarah socha hai <end>
<begin> it seems odd that they dont ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene <end>	<begin> ajeeb hai ki woh kissi scientist ya marine biologist ko beech mein nahi laa rahe <end>
<begin> even the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook the shark or harpoon it <end>	<begin> last scene mein bhi bohot hi limited plan hai shark ko hook ya harpoon karne ka <end>
<begin> i agree they have an oceanographer to help determine a shark attack but no scientists ever get brought in to help the situation <end>	<begin> sahi i agree unke paas shark attack determine karne ke liye ek oceanographer hai par koi scientists nahi laaye help karne ke liye <end>
<begin> it seems like a pretty poor plan and they end up having to make it up as they go along <end>	<begin> kaafi bekar plan hai aur aage jaate jaate woh plan banaate jaa rahe hain <end>
<begin> it seems crazy that a shark could take out a shark proof cage <end>	<begin> kitna crazy hai ki shark ne shark proof cage todd diya <end>
<begin> plus the reward of only currency <number> seems pretty low to risk lives <end>	<begin> aur currency <number> ka reward bohot kam hai life risk karne ke liye <end>
<begin> maybe it was worth a lot more in <number> <end>	<begin> shayad <number> mein isse zyaada worth tha <end>
<begin> i agree not worth it to me ill go on vacation in nyc instead and avoid the shark haha <end>	<begin> haan mere liye toh worth nahi hai shark ko chhod ke main nyc vacation par chala jaoonga haha <end>
<begin> and it was definitely worth more in <number> i just dont know how much <end>	<begin> aur yeh <number> definitely adhik kimat ka hogame nahi janti how much <end>
<begin> what did you think of gal gadots portrayal of wonder woman <end>	<begin> wonder woman mei gal gadots portrayal ke bare mei kya khayal hai <end>
<begin> i thought she did a great job <end>	<begin> mere khayal se usne bahut achcha kaam kiya <end>
<begin> what did you think <end>	<begin> tumhara kya khayal hai <end>
<begin> i agree loved it <end>	<begin> mei sahmat hui payaar se <end>
<begin> i thought she was a great choice <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki ye bahut achchi pasad thi <end>
<begin> me too <end>	<begin> mei bhi <end>
<begin> she was unknown to me before <end>	<begin> ye pahale mujhse anjaan thi <end>
<begin> do you know if she was in anything before wonder woman <end>	<begin> kya aap iske baare mei janate hai wonder woman ke pahale <end>
<begin> so what else did you like <end>	<begin> to aapako aur kya pasand aaya <end>
<begin> i didnt know billy crystal was the voice of mike but i love it <end>	<begin> mujhe nahi mahum thai ki billy crystal mike ki voice the but achcha tha <end>
<begin> steve buscemi is in this too <end>	<begin> steve buscemi bhi isme hai <end>
<begin> yes he is im guessing youve seen monsters university <end>	<begin> haa vo hai mene shoch ki tumne monsters university dekha hai <end>
<begin> i did when it came out years ago just never thought to look at the voice acting <end>	<begin> mene kiya jab ye kuch saal pahale aa gai thi mene nahi socha tha ki voice acting hogi <end>
<begin> when did you see it <end>	<begin> tumne kab dekha <end>
<begin> hello how are <end>	<begin> hello kaise he <end>
<begin> you doing <end>	<begin> aap kar rahe hai <end>
<begin> hi im doing well thanks <end>	<begin> hi main accha kar raha hun thanks <end>
<begin> so what did you think of the blind side <end>	<begin> so aapne blind side ke baare me kya socha <end>
<begin> i love sports documentaries so i favored this movie h ow about you <end>	<begin> mujhe sports documentaries pasand hai so main in movies ka favor karta hun aapka baare me kya hai <end>
<begin> it was quite good im not surprised it got such good reviews on cinemascore <end>	<begin> ye quite good tha main surprised nahi hun ki ise cinemascore me itne acche reviews mile <end>
<begin> same here it is a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like metacritic i take it you like sports docs too <end>	<begin> same here ye little odd hai ki ise dusre platforms par lower reviews mile jaise ki metacritic main apko sports docs ki tarah leta hun <end>
<begin> yes very much its surprising how much adversity oher had to overcome dont you think <end>	<begin> yes bahut had tak main surprise hun ki kitne adversity oher ko kam karni padegi aapko nahi lagta <end>
<begin> yeah it mustve been really difficult on him i wonder how he felt having to relive his experience through the movie i dont know how i would handle it <end>	<begin> yeah ye nischit hi unhe liye kafi difficult hoga i wonder kaise unhone is movie ke dwara apne experience ko relive karna mahsoos kiya hoga main nahi jaanta ki main ise kaise handle karuga <end>
<begin> did you like sandra bullock in the movie <end>	<begin> kya tumhe sandra bullock is movie me pasand aayi <end>
<begin> yeah bullock was great although shes a great actor so i think she does well in most of her roles <end>	<begin> hann bullock great thi waise bhi woh great actor hai and zyadatar roles mein achcha hi karti hai <end>
<begin> totally agree easy to see why the critics applauded her performance <end>	<begin> main totally manta hoon easily dikhta hai critics kyon use performance ko applaud karte hain <end>
<begin> any thoughts on any of the other actors i had forgotten tim mcgraw was in the movie haha <end>	<begin> doosre actors ke baare mein kya thoughts hain main bhook gaya tha ki tim mcgraw bhi movie mein tha haha <end>
<begin> i thought quinton aaron was very good too <end>	<begin> mujhe laga quinton aaron bhi bahut achcha tha <end>
<begin> it must have been tough to go through foster care so much but i think its good that oher found something to latch on to in football <end>	<begin> foster care se guzarna bahut mushkil hua hoga par achchi baat hai football mein oher ko naya sahara mila <end>
<begin> yeah he certainly excelled in it i think he was able to apply his protective qualities in his personality to football <end>	<begin> haan usne bahut hi achcha pradarshan kiya mujhe lagta hai usne apne personality ke protective qualities to football mein dikhaya <end>
<begin> definitely he was also very lucky to finally find a good foster family its super difficult to find a good family that cares about their foster kids <end>	<begin> bilkul woh bahut lucky tha ki use achcha foster family mil gayi ek achche family ka milna bahut mushkil hai jo apne foster kids ka care karti hai <end>
<begin> yeah i would imagine that its hard i feel like thats why it was such agood movie nothing seemed to be all that good in his life until he found a family that would treat him like one of their own <end>	<begin> haan yeh kitna hard hai main samaj sakta hoon mujhe lagta hai yeh movie isi liye itna achcha laga uski zindagi mein kuch bhi achcha nahin tha jab tak us family ko usne dekha jo use apna samajte the <end>
<begin> what do you think of the idea of protective instincts and how it influenced ohers behavior <end>	<begin> tumhe protective instincts idea kaise lagta hai aur is idea ne oher ke behavior ko kaise influence kiya <end>
<begin> i remember he ranked very high when he was taking his career test it definitely translated well into his efforts in football do you think that helped his family as well <end>	<begin> mujhe yaad hai uska rank bahut achcha tha jab woh career test le raha tha yeh rank use football mein achche efforts dalne me kaam aya kya tumhe lagta hai ki is se uski family ko bhi help mili <end>
<begin> im sure it did its ironic though that he has such strong protective instincts when he was abandoned by his mother do you think he was overcompensating <end>	<begin> main sure hoon aisa hi hua magar usme itna stron protective instincts hain jabki usi maa ne use abandon kar diya tha kya tumhe lagta hai ki woh overcompensate kar raha tha <end>
<begin> how did you feel about the scene where collins adopts oher <end>	<begin> tumhe woh scene kaise laga jahan collins oher ko adopt karta hai <end>
<begin> as for being overcompensating that he was not i think that was built naturally in him where he was not consciously trying to do it <end>	<begin> mujhe nahin lagta ki woh overcompensate kar raha tha mujhe lagta hai yeh usme naturally built hai aur woh consciously karne ki koshish nahin kar raha tha <end>

<begin> very well said some of the critics were out of their minds especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half flat and unsurprising <end>	<begin> sahi kaha kuchh critics pagal ho gaye hain khash kar woh jiska apne description diya aur woh jisne first half ko flat aur unsurprising bataya <end>

<begin> i couldnt imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band i found that part very funny <end>	<begin> muje tho imagine bhi nahi kar saktha ki yeh sab danger tha mera childhood mein lekin voh tho polka band se hitch hike huva muje tho us part ko badi funny laga <end>
<begin> same here and in a moving van at that that was incredibly hilarious <end>	<begin> yahi bhi aur voh moving van tho badiya thi voh tho incredibly hilarious hein <end>
<begin> imagine going through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a holiday and not even being able to enjoy your time on the trip that wouldnt be good at all for me i would be so mad <end>	<begin> soch le agar yeh halfway flying mein troble hein aur jab voh holiday ke liye jaa raha hein lekin usko us time ko enjoy nahi kar saka tho yeh sab ache nahi hein na yeh tho mad ke tarah hein <end>
<begin> i know right at that point i felt sorry for kate as well then on top of that you can only land a flight to scranton and while there all flights to chicago were booked talk about stressful <end>	<begin> mujhe pata hai right us point par mujhe kate ke liye sorry feel huya aur uske top par tum sirf scranton ki flight land kar sakte ho aur jab tum wahan ho chicago ki sari flights book thi kitna stressful hai <end>
<begin> for sure very stressful i wonder what the family was thinking back in paris at the apartment of kevins uncle <end>	<begin> han sure very stressful i wonder wo family paris mein kevin ke uncle ke apartment mein kya think kar rahi hogi <end>
<begin> their vacation was certainly ruined while kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for harry and marv that was a hilarious scene as well <end>	<begin> unki vacation certainly ruin hogayi hogi jab kevin unke house ko booby traps se rig karne ke process mein tha harry aur marv ke liye wo scene bhi hilarious tha <end>
<begin> kevin was a kid genius rigging up the house like mini macgyver of course seeing marv and harry get tricked was very funny thank god marley got there before kevin got hurt <end>	<begin> kevin kid genius tha mini macgyver ki tarah house ko rig karne mein ofcourse marv aur harry ko trick hote dekhna funny tha thank god marley kevin ke hurt hone se pehle wahan pahunch gaya <end>
<begin> youre right thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest harry and marv <end>	<begin> tum sahi ho thankfully wo wahan time par pahunch gaya aur cops thode time mein harry aur marv ko arrest karne aa gaye <end>
<begin> i love seeing the whole family reunited at the end having kevin realize he didnt want his family to go away was very touching <end>	<begin> muje whole family ko last mein reunite hote dekhkar kafi accha laga kevin ka ye realize karna ki wo apni family ko door nahi jane dena chahta bohat touching tha <end>
<begin> it was especially after he sees the family was still gone on christmas day at first before kate entered the house calling for him <end>	<begin> han wo tha especially jab wo dekhta hai ki uski family christmas day par abhi bhi gayi huyi hai kate ke ghar mein enter karke bulane se pehle <end>
<begin> i do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone i would figure the police might be interested to talk to kevins parents <end>	<begin> mujhe ye interesting laga ki kisine family ko nahi inform kiya ki jab wo gaye they tab ghar mein kya events huye mujhe lagta hai police shayad kevin ke parents se baat karne mein interested ho <end>
<begin> i agree but it was hilarious when buzz yelled kevin what did you do to me room and kevin ran off at the end i enjoyed discussing home alone with you today <end>	<begin> i agree jab buzz yell karta hai kevin what did you do to me room wo bohat hilarious tha aur end me kevin bhag jata hai mujhe aaj tumse home alone discuss karke kafi acha laga <end>

<begin> i know i dont get that either since it was the best in its time and still is today in my opinion <end>	<begin> mujhe pata hai mujhe nahin lagata hai ki ya to yah us samay mein sabase achchha tha aur aaj bhee hai meree raay mein <end>
<begin> agreed i still like watching it when its on tv ive been known to download it for a long flight too the cast was outstanding and the music still gets me creeped out <end>	<begin> maana main abhee bhee ise dekhana pasand karata hoon jab teevee par isakee mujhe ise lambee udaan ke lie bhee daunalod karane ke lie jaana jaata hai kaast bakaaya tha aur sangeet abhee bhee mujhe baahar nikaal diya jaata hai <end>
<begin> same here my wife hates those movies and dont like to see them <end>	<begin> mujhe bhee meree patnee un philmon se napharat karatee hai aur unhen dekhana pasand nahin karatee <end>
<begin> i dont know how she can hate it but its my favorite <end>	<begin> mujhe nahin pata ki vah ise kaise napharat kar sakatee hai lekin yah mera pasandeeda hai <end>
<begin> i saw that the critics found it funny in a weird sort of way i think i kind of agree with that comment there are moments that are funny i cant say i agree with your wife but it did scare some people too much maybe it scares her and thats why she hates it <end>	<begin> mainne dekha ki aalochakon ko yah ajeeb tarah se ajeeb laga mujhe lagata hai ki main us tippanee se sahamat hoon aise kshan hain jo majaakiya hain main yah nahin kah sakata ki main aapakee patnee se sahamat hoon lekin isane kuchh logon ko bahut dara diya ho sakata hai ki vah use daraatee hai aur usase napharat karatee hai <end>
<begin> i kind of enjoyed the scary moments in it <end>	<begin> mainne isamen daraavane palon ka aanand liya <end>
<begin> its so realistic and it could happen <end>	<begin> yah bahut yathaarthavaadee hai aur aisa ho sakata hai <end>
<begin> it does happen more than you think <end>	<begin> yah aapake vichaar se adhik hota hai <end>
<begin> it has happened thats whats so scary several attacks likek that off the east coast last summerfelt like i was living jaws i stayed off the beach last summer <end>	<begin> ho chuka hai kya itana daraavana hai pichhalee garmiyon mein poorvee tat se door jaise kaee hamale hue the main pichhalee garmiyon mein samudr tat se door raha <end>
<begin> so did i it freaked me out too much <end>	<begin> to kya mainne isane mujhe bahut adhik prabhaavit kiya <end>
<begin> in the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safe kind of like when we see a dolphin fin scream and then realize it was okthe next day they see a great white in the same area of the beach jaws for real <end>	<begin> philm mein ek baagh shaark paaya gaya tha taaki unhen laga ki samudr tat surakshit hai ek tarah se jab ham dolphin phin dekhate hain chillaate hain aur tab mahasoos hota hai ki yah theek hai agale din ve samudr tat ke ek hee kshetr mein ek mahaan saphed dekhate hain asalee ke lie jabade <end>
<begin> i know one reason why i try and stay out of the oceans <end>	<begin> mujhe pata hai ek kaaran hai ki main koshish karata hoon aur mahaasaagaron se baahar rahata hoon <end>
<begin> i know theres an alligator hunter that finds and removes those guys in the movie they paid quint richard dreyfus to find the shark who would do that in real life not me <end>	<begin> mujhe pata hai ki ek magaramachchh shikaaree ko dhoondhata hai aur un logon ko nikaalata hai shaark ko khojane ke lie philm mein unhonne kvint richard drephas ko bhugataan kiya asal jindagee mein kaun aisa karega main nahin <end>
<begin> k or not i would not get in that water or that boat if a great white were out there <end>	<begin> k ya nahin main us paanee ya us naav mein nahin jaata agar ek mahaan saphed vahaan se baahar hota <end>
<begin> no way i wouldnt either <end>	<begin> koee raasta nahin main bhee nahin hoga <end>
<begin> nope not at all <end>	<begin> nahin bilkul nahin <end>
<begin> sounds like youre pretty clever ironic they named the boat the orca in the movie those orcas are supposed to be pretty safe <end>	<begin> lagata hai ki tum bahut chaalaak ho vidambana hai ki unhonne philm mein naav ka naam orka rakha hai un orchas bahut surakshit maana jaata hai <end>
<begin> yeah you know when you hear the music look out <end>	<begin> haan aap jaanate hain ki jab aap sangeet sunate hain to baahar dekhen <end>
<begin> and can you imagine what it was like getting in a shark proof cage i know someone who did that once they said theyd never do it again <end>	<begin> aur kya aap kalpana kar sakate hain ki shaark prooph kej mein aisa kya tha main kisee aise vyakti ko jaanata hoon jisane ek baar aisa kiya tha unhonne kaha ki ve ise phir kabhee nahin karenge <end>
<begin> no way i would have a heart attack <end>	<begin> bilkul nahin mujhe dil ka daura padega <end>
<begin> well at least jaws had a happy ending not for the shark though the good old days when they made you feel good before you left the movie <end>	<begin> jaws film me khush anth hua lekin shark ke liye nahi pahle dino jaise hame movie dekar nikalne se pahle acha lagtha hai <end>

<begin> how was the story in your opinion <end>	<begin> apki raay se story kaisi thi <end>
<begin> it does not crowd the film in my opinion unlike how it turned out with batman and robin <end>	<begin> mere raay se yeh film ko bhara hua nhi dikhate iske vipreet yeh batman aur robin ke saath kaise hua <end>
<begin> you can have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly <end>	<begin> tum bahut se villians le skte ho jab tak ki tum unhe achhe se use krte ho <end>
<begin> i thought it was a great story overall very solid <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta tha ki ye ek mahan kahani hai kul milaakar bahut solid <end>

<begin> have you seen it <end>	<begin> kya tumne use dekha hai <end>
<begin> yeah i wanted to talk about it because i like how david fincher directed it <end>	<begin> yeah me uske baare me baat karna chahta hun jaise david fincher ne ise direct kiya mujhe pasand aaya <end>
<begin> ok <end>	<begin> ok <end>
<begin> did you see it <end>	<begin> kya aap dekha <end>
<begin> did you enjoy it <end>	<begin> kya aap enjoy kiya <end>
<begin> yes i did <end>	<begin> haan yar <end>
<begin> yeah a lot sorkin and fincher sure laced their scathing wit with an aching sadness you know i guess everybody says that though <end>	<begin> bahut yar sorkin aur fincher tho apni aching sadness ko tho badiya scathing kare aapko patha hein i guess ki sabhi aise hi sochthe honge <end>
<begin> ok i wasnt aware it was based on a book <end>	<begin> ok muje iska koi aware nahi hein lekin yeh book ke based hoga <end>
<begin> yeah though i guess the movie isnt quite as factual as the book and that the book is pretty heavily debated <end>	<begin> haan book se compare kare tho yeh movie itna bhi ache nahi hein kyon aur book tho heavily debated tha <end>
<begin> i see <end>	<begin> acha <end>
<begin> you remember that bit where zuckerberg gets dumped and then writes a mean post about his ex <end>	<begin> aapko yaad hein ki zuckerberg tho kuch samai dumped tha aur voh apne ex se badi mean tha <end>
<begin> im not a fan of facebook or zukerbeg but i thought the movie was well done i dont remember that part specifically <end>	<begin> mein zukerberg ka fan nahi hoon lekin movie tho badiya nikla muje uska yaad kuch nahi aatha <end>
<begin> yeah no im no fan of either either but it was that scene that kind said everything that needed to be said about the mentality behind that site i thought that was pretty brilliant <end>	<begin> haan yar mein bhi uska fan nahi hoon lekin is scene mein tho kuch aise dekhaya gaya hein ki voh usse mentaly lead kar raha hein voh tho brilliant hein <end>
<begin> it seems to be highly rated <end>	<begin> ye kafi high rated dikhti hai <end>
<begin> yeah its definitely a strong movie i mean its a movie about facebook that is actually watchable thats saying something <end>	<begin> han ye definitely ek strong movie hai mera matlab ye facebook par aisi movie hai jo watchable hai bahut badi baat hai <end>
<begin> yes iwas thinking that as well <end>	<begin> han main bhi yahi soch raha tha <end>
<begin> it is even more trajic where it has brought us politically <end>	<begin> ye aur bhi tragic hai ki ye hume politically kahan le aya <end>
<begin> for sure and i feel like its all in that bit where sean parker has his line about you know what is cool a billion dollars like its presented as a way to keep people in touch but its really the coldest corporate type of thing <end>	<begin> sach mein aur mujhe lagta hai ye sab usme bit mein hai jahan sean parker ki line hai you know what is cool a billion dollars like ye aise way mein presented hai ki people touch mein rahein par ye really bohat cold corporate type ki thing hai <end>
<begin> yes greed is powerfull <end>	<begin> han greed powerful hai <end>
<begin> did you know sean parker was the founder of napster <end>	<begin> kya tum jante ho sean parker napster ka founder tha <end>
<begin> yes <end>	<begin> yes <end>
<begin> it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of the <end>	<begin> ye interesting hai kaise usne the se rid karne ka suggest <end>
<begin> yes i was just about to say that i think its crazy how much influence he had on facebook when it started out <end>	<begin> han main wahi bolne wala tha mujhe lagta hai ye crazy hai uske pas kitna zyada influence tha jab facebook start hua <end>
<begin> then theres that last scene where zuckerberg keeps refreshing his page to see if his ex girlfriend has accepted his friend request thats what it all comes back to after all the greed youve still got these human needs <end>	<begin> aur ek last sceme hai jahan zuckerberg apne page ko refresh karta rahta hai yeh dekhne ke liye ki kya uske ex girlfriend ne uska friend request accept kiya hai ya nahin last mein yehi sab hota hai saare greed ke baad tumhe human needs ki zaroorat hai <end>
<begin> it is interesting for sure <end>	<begin> hann yeh zaroor interesting hai <end>
<begin> it would be funny if it was still called f acemash <end>	<begin> bahut funny hota agar ise abhi bhi facemash kaha jaata <end>
<begin> i know that was a pretty weird name even facebook seemed weird back in the day <end>	<begin> mujhe pata hai ki woh ek achcha weird naam tha un dino mein facebook bhi weird hua karta tha <end>
<begin> i think it is a dangerous false reality that has changed humanity for the worse <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai yeh ek khatarnak flase reality hai jisne humanity ko bilkul badal diya hai <end>
<begin> millions are addicted to it and it is proven to shape perceptions in false ways <end>	<begin> lakhon log iske peeche addicted hain and maana jaata hai ki yeh perceptions ko galat tareeke se shape karta hai <end>
<begin> yeah i think so too though i also think there is a natural balance of humanity and that at some point facebook will be left in the dust or at least its worst aspects will be again i just think about that last scene maybe its too optimistic but i think people will abandon facebook maybe not this generation but the next <end>	<begin> haan mujhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai par mujhe aisa bhi lagta hai ki humanity ka ek natural balance bhi hai magar kabhi na kabhi facebook dust mein mil jayega ya kam se kam uske worst aspects dust mein honge main phie se us last sceme ke baare mein sochta hoon ho sakta hai main bahut optimistic hoon but mere khayal se log facebook abandon kar denge yeh generation nahin to agla generation <end>
<begin> was there anything you didnt like about the movie <end>	<begin> movie mein kya aisa kuch tha jo tumne like nahin kiya <end>
<begin> it seems to be in that direction to some point already a lot of damage has been done though <end>	<begin> haan kuch had tak mujhe laga ki us direction mein ja raha hai kaafi had tak damage to ho chuka hai <end>
<begin> i think we are done now have a good day <end>	<begin> i think baat khatam ho gayi tumhara din achcha ho <end>

<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>
<begin> hello so the movie we will be talking about is batman v superman <end>	<begin> hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai batman v superman <end>
<begin> great i havent actually seen that yet but have been really wanting to which actors play batman and superman <end>	<begin> great maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai but sahi me dekhna chahta hu batman aur superman kaun actors bane hai <end>
<begin> the actors are really great and you probably know all of them ben affleck henry cavill amy adams and jesse eisenberg to name a few <end>	<begin> actor bohot aache hai aur tum shaiyad sabko jante ho ben affleck henry cavill amy adams aur jesse eisenberg kuch naam hai <end>
<begin> oh that is a great cast henry cavill played superman in the latest superman film right <end>	<begin> oh ye to bohot aachi cast hai henry cavill ne superman ka kirdaar nibhaya tha na latest superman film me <end>
<begin> sorry a great cast <end>	<begin> maaf karna ek aachi cast <end>
<begin> i am not sure but the film is still a part of the dc extended universe also it will be featuring wonder woman <end>	<begin> mai nahi bol sakta lekin film ek part hai dc extended universe ka aur vo naya kirdar wonder women bhi dikhayenge <end>
<begin> ooh that is excellent i am looking forward to seeing wonder woman are batman and superman enemies at the start of the film <end>	<begin> ye to kaafi aacha hai mai wonder women ko deekhna chahunga kyaa batman aur superman dushman hai movie chalu hote samay <end>
<begin> well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman <end>	<begin> kyaa lex luthor uksayega batman ko ek ladai ke liye superman ke saath kyunki vo obssessed hai clone superman se <end>
<begin> oh so batman is supposed to bring superman to lex luthor <end>	<begin> oh batman superman ko lex luthor ke paas lekar jata hai <end>
<begin> no that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping by the way did i mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together <end>	<begin> nahi ye case nahi hai jabki vo uksata hai madat karne ko kyaa maine bataya ke ye pehli baar hai ke batman aur superman ek saath movie me hai <end>
<begin> really the first time that seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long very cool is the story set in metropolis or gotham <end>	<begin> sahi me pehli baar ye kaafi aacha sunai deta hai ke kirdaar aas paas rahe hai itne samay se kaafi aacha ye story metropolis me hai ya gotham me <end>
<begin> the film appears to take place in both cities and batman comes to view superman as a threat to humanity <end>	<begin> film dono jagah hoti hai aur batman superman ko ek khatre ke tarah deekhta hai manavta ke liye <end>
<begin> that is interesting to have the film set in both cities so batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take superman down <end>	<begin> yeh interesting hai dono cities mein film set hona to batman ne superman ko neecha le jana kuch hadd tak apni duty mani hai <end>
<begin> well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because clark kent aka superman learns of batmans justice methods and tries to expose him all this happening while lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator <end>	<begin> khair characters ke relationships kafi complex hai kyunki clark kent aka superman batman ke justice krne ke tarike sikh gya hai or use expose krne ki koshish krta hai ye sab tab hota hai jan lex luthor ek senator se kryptonite lene ka approval lene ke liye chaalein chalta hai <end>
<begin> interesting and so i imagine lois lane is in this story if so does she serve a greater purpose does she know both superheroes <end>	<begin> dilachasp aur isliye mujhe lagta hai ki kahani mein lois lane hai agar aisa hai to kya wo koi bada purpose serve kr rahi hai kya use dono superheroes ke baare mein pta hai <end>
<begin> maybe but i am not sure by the way do you usually care about reviews <end>	<begin> shayad but main sure nhi huin vaise tum aamataur par reviews ki paravaah karte ho <end>
<begin> i will often read reviews to see what people have to say but i dont change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews i think that i cant really know unless i see for myself do you care about reviews <end>	<begin> main aksar reviews ko padhta hoon ki logon ka kya kahana hai lekin main reviews ke aadhaar par movie dekhne ke baare mein apana mann nahin badalata huin mujhe lagata hai ki main vaastav mein tab tak nahin jaan sakta jab tak ki main kud se nahi dekhta kya tum reviews ki paravaah karte ho <end>
<begin> not usually i like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not i watch in theatres i have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed <end>	<begin> aamataur par main apana khud ka judge banna pasand karta huin lekin agar reviews bahut bure ya achhe hai to yeh influence kar sakta hai ki main cinema main dekhta hoon ya nahin mujhe is movie ke lie kehna hoga haalaanki reviews kaafi mixed hai <end>
<begin> did you enjoy this film <end>	<begin> kya tumne ye film enjoy ki <end>
<begin> i did i really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman <end>	<begin> han mujhe vaastav mein un scenes ko dekhna pasand tha jahaan batman superman ko vash mein karne ke arrangements karta hai <end>
<begin> cool i guess thats one of the ultimate questions which one could beat out the other do they team up at all in the film <end>	<begin> badiya mujhe lagata hai ki yeh param savaalon mein se ek hai kaun dusre ko hara sakta hai kya ve film mein team up krte hai <end>
<begin> yes in batman chooses to save supermans mother while superman confonts lex <end>	<begin> han batman superman ki maa ko bachaane ko chunta hai jabaki superman lex ka saamana karta hai <end>
<begin> oh wow the pairing of batman and supermans mom is a really cool part of the story heartwarming <end>	<begin> tho acha hein yeh tho batman aur superman ka mummy ka pairing hein jo bahut cool hein aur heartwarming hein <end>
<begin> i know but the film ends with sadly the death of superman <end>	<begin> muje patha tha lekin is film ka end tho superman ka mouth tho bada sad huva <end>
<begin> oh wow i am surprised by that i thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two <end>	<begin> are vah mein tho surprised huva lekin mein soch raha hoon ki is story line tho dusra movie se likha gaya hein <end>
<begin> dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the director <end>	<begin> coffin ka vibrates ke baare mein koi worry na kare kyon ki is wink us director ka hein <end>
<begin> haha thats the closing shot <end>	<begin> ha ha yeh tho closing shot nikhla <end>

<begin> that sounds really interesting how does the movie end <end>	<begin> yeh sunne mein toh bhaut interesting hai movie ka end kaisa hai <end>
<begin> would you watch it again <end>	<begin> kya tum dubara dekhoge <end>
<begin> i would watch it again i saw it in theaters so i am not positive on how it ends but i know that it ends with the rabbit officer proving that she may be small but she wont be intimidated and will do her job to the best of her abilities <end>	<begin> han main dubara dekhunga maine ye theater mein dekhi thi so main sahi se nhi bta skta ki ye end kaise hui but mujhe ye pta hai ki ye rabbit officer ke saath end hui thi jo ye saabit krta hai ki wo chhoti ho skti hai par dari hui nhi ho skti or apni ability ke according kam karegi <end>
<begin> she sounds like a great officer <end>	<begin> wo ek mahan officer ki tarah sound krti hai <end>
<begin> she was quite inspiring <end>	<begin> wo kafi inspire karti hai <end>
<begin> who plays all the voices in the movie <end>	<begin> film mein saari awaazein kisne di hai <end>
<begin> ginnifer goodwin is officer judy hopps jason bateman plays nick wilde idris elba is chief bogo and jenny slate is dawn bellwether <end>	<begin> officer judy hopps ki ginnifer goodwin ne nick wilde ki jason bateman ne chief bogo ki idris elba ne or dawn bellwether ki jenny slate ne awaaz di hai <end>

<begin> they cannot try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one since the officer proved her self already <end>	<begin> woh cannot try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one kyunki officer proved her self already <end>
<begin> maybe a little guy can beat the officer <end>	<begin> ho sakta hai ki little guy beat the officer <end>
<begin> like the rocket snail <end>	<begin> rocket snail ki tarah <end>
<begin> that could be true but do we want to see a movie where the bad guy wins <end>	<begin> woh sahi ho sakta hai but kya hum want to see a movie where the bad guy wins <end>
<begin> true but than they could make a third movie where the officer learns how to defeat the guy eventually <end>	<begin> sahi hai but than they could make a third movie jahan officer learns bure logo ko kaisse defeat kare <end>
<begin> i see your point i fear that you may dissuade people from watching a third movie if they were put off from seeing the villain win in the second movie <end>	<begin> i see your point lekin kujhe darr hai ki you may dissuade people from watching a third movie agar unko second movie mein villian ka jeetna pasand nahi aaya <end>
<begin> it does open up the plot to a third movie but would rather see a cliffhanger than the enemy win <end>	<begin> ye third movie ke liye plot open karta to hai lekin would rather see a cliffhanger than the enemy win <end>
<begin> thats true no one at the end of the day wants to see the enemy win <end>	<begin> ye sach hai at the end of the day koi dushman ko jeette hue nahi dekhna chahta <end>
<begin> do you think there was a hidden message in the movie <end>	<begin> tumhe lagta hai ki movie mein koi hidden message hai <end>

<begin> omg craig ferguson is a riot <end>	<begin> hea god craig ferguson to swayam hi riot he <end>
<begin> yes he does such a great job the hashtag work is truly magical <end>	<begin> ha voh bahut hi great perform karta he d work to really magical he <end>
<begin> what is it about besides the obvious of dragon training of course <end>	<begin> kis baare me hai obvious dragon training ko chhod ke <end>
<begin> it is a coming to age story and has great friendship morals <end>	<begin> ye ek coming of age story hai aur bahut acche friendship morals hai <end>
<begin> does the dragon talk <end>	<begin> kya dragon baat kar sakte hai <end>
<begin> one of the best scenes is when the dragon hiccup is attacked by the bad guy night fury and rather than killing him he sets him free <end>	<begin> best scenes me se ek hai jab dragon hiccup ko bad guy night fury attack aur hai aur usne maarne k bajaye jaane deta hai <end>
<begin> yes all of the dragons have some lines <end>	<begin> haan sabhi dragon ki kuch lines hai <end>
<begin> so the dragons name is hiccup <end>	<begin> to dragon ka naam hiccup hai <end>
<begin> yes the two main dragons are named hiccup and night fury <end>	<begin> haan <number> main dragon hai hiccup aur night fury <end>
<begin> okay night fury freed hiccup then <end>	<begin> accha night fury hiccup ko chhod deta hai phir <end>

<begin> did the dragons breathe fire <end>	<begin> kya dragons fire breath karte hai <end>
<begin> another important scene is when hiccups owner sees that night fury is hurt and can not fly he makes him a prostectic wing and thats how he teaches him how to fly <end>	<begin> ek aur mahatvapoorn drshy hai jab hichakee ke maalik ne dekha ki nait phyooree ko chot lagee hai aur vah ud nahin sakata hai vah use ek prosthetik ving banaata hai aur vah use udane ka tareeka sikhaata hai <end>
<begin> im not too sure but i bet they do they probably only use it for good though since it is an animated movie aimed towards kids <end>	<begin> mujhe yakeen nahin hai lekin mujhe yakeen hai ki ve karate hain ve shaayad keval achchhe ke lie isaka upayog karate hain kyonki yah ek enimeted philm hai jisaka uddeshy bachchon kee or hai <end>
<begin> which part did craig ferguson give <end>	<begin> craig ferguson ne kaun sa bhaag diya <end>
<begin> i would probably see this movie just because he is in it do you think its a good one to watch <end>	<begin> main shaayad yah philm sirph isalie dekhoonga kyonki vah isamen hai kya aapako lagata hai ki yah dekhana achchha hai <end>
<begin> i meant to say which part did craig ferguson play <end>	<begin> mere kahane ka matalab hai craig ferguson ne kaun sa bhaag khela <end>
<begin> he played gobber the belch who was the training masters of the young warriors <end>	<begin> unhonne gobar da belch kee bhoomika nibhaee jo yuva yoddhaon ke prashikshan ke svaamee the <end>
<begin> were the warriors humans or dragons <end>	<begin> yoddha manushy the ya dregan <end>
<begin> well if you only like him then maybe no because his role is not a main role if you like movies of the same genre then it may be a good fit <end>	<begin> yadi aap keval use pasand karate hain to shaayad nahin kyonki usakee bhoomika mukhy bhoomika nahin hai agar aap ek hee jonar kee philmen pasand karate hain to yah ek achchhee phit ho sakatee hai <end>
<begin> it is a great movie to watch with children <end>	<begin> bachchon ke saath dekhana ek behatareen philm hai <end>
<begin> the warriors were humans and they were mostly kids they owned and trained the dragons <end>	<begin> yoddha manushy the aur ve jyaadaatar bachche the ve dregan ke svaamitv aur prashikshit the <end>
<begin> do you like movies like this <end>	<begin> apko aisi movie pasand hai <end>

<begin> toothless is my favorite dragon <end>	<begin> toothless mera favorite dragon hai <end>
<begin> toothless is a great character hiccup was supposed to kill him in the beginning but couldnt bring himself to do it and instead sets him free <end>	<begin> toothless ek great character hai hiccup asal me use maarne wala tha but mar nahi paya aur use free kar diya <end>
<begin> he gradually tames the dragon and calls him toothless because of his retractable teech <end>	<begin> wo gradually dragon ko tame karta hai aur use toothless bulata hai kyuki uske retractable teeth hai <end>
<begin> it was becuase of toothless that hiccup learned how to tame other dragons <end>	<begin> toothless ki wajah se hiccup baki dragons ko bhi tame karna seekh gaya <end>
<begin> do you think hiccup cheats because of what he learns from toothless by using it his training class <end>	<begin> kya tumhe lagta hai hiccup cheat karta jo bhi toothless se seekha apni training class me wo chez use karke <end>
<begin> he become proficient in subduing the captive dragons i dont know how much you can call that cheating <end>	<begin> wo captive dragons ko vas karne me kushal ho gaya uko aap cheating kaise keh sakte hai <end>
<begin> but he wouldnt have known that without having toothless <end>	<begin> lekin wo ye toothless ke bina nahi jan pata <end>
<begin> so maybe just an advantage not cheating <end>	<begin> to sayad wo advantage ho cheating nahi <end>
<begin> how do you feel about how stoick treats hiccup <end>	<begin> aapko kya lag raha he ki stoick hiccup ke sath kya kar raha hai <end>
<begin> stoick leaving hiccup but then arriving home unscucessful and finding how hiccup had trained the dragons led to a celebration <end>	<begin> stoick hiccup ko chhod raha hai lekin phir ghar mein becheni se pahuncha aur paaya ki hiccup ne dragons ko kis tarah prashikshit kiya tha <end>
<begin> i mean throughout the whole movie he was rather harsh to him in the beginning <end>	<begin> mera matalab hai puri movie ke dauran vah suruat mein usake prati kathor nahin tha <end>
<begin> stoick uses hiccup when hiccups accidently reveals that toothless can locate the dragons nest stoick disowns his son <end>	<begin> stoick hiccup ka upayog karata hai jab hiccups ko akasmik rup se pata chalata hai ki toothless dragon ke ghosle ka pata laga sakata hai stoick ne apane bete ko nanga kar diya <end>
<begin> that to me is very harsh <end>	<begin> mere liye yah bahut harsh hai <end>
<begin> however when hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless stoick saves them both reconciling with his son <end>	<begin> halaki jab hiccup lagabhag toothless ko chhudane ki koshish mein doob jata hai to stoick apane bete ke saath un dono ko bacha leta hai <end>
<begin> did you like the ending how they make hiccup and toothless basically equal both missing something vital <end>	<begin> kya aapako ending pasand aaya ve hiccup aur toothless ko mul rup se samaan kaise banate hain donon me kuchh vital yaad aa rahee hai <end>
<begin> how do you feel about the rotten tomatoes <number> score <end>	<begin> kya rotten tomatoes ka score <number> sahi hei kya <end>
<begin> yes when hiccup wakes up on berk his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis so he and toothless are the same <end>	<begin> haan jab hiccup berk ke paas wakeup kiya tho uska lower left leg miss hota aur usse prothesis ho jatha tho uska daad bhi nahi rehatha <end>
<begin> i thought a <number> was a good score on rotton tomatoes <end>	<begin> mein tho <number> laga aur uska score tho kaafi ache hein rotten tomatoes ka <end>
<begin> hey <end>	<begin> hey <end>
<begin> hi <end>	<begin> hi <end>

<begin> i also think ruffalo is a great hulk <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi lagta hai ruffalo badhiya hulk hai <end>
<begin> is avengers the movie were supposed to talk about <end>	<begin> kya avengers wo movie hai jiske baare me ham baat karne wale hai <end>
<begin> rotten tomatoes gave it a <number> rating and average of <number> <number> yes i believe so <end>	<begin> rotten tomatoes ne use <number> rating aur average <number> <number> ka haan yahi lagta hai <end>
<begin> okay then right ive always experiened that imdb gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes <end>	<begin> okay phir mujhe yahi experience hua hai k imdb rotten tomatoes se lower average rating deti hai <end>
<begin> tha <end>	<begin> tha <end>
<begin> thats true <end>	<begin> haan sach hai <end>
<begin> but i guess <number> and <number> are a fair assesment <end>	<begin> lekin i guess <number> aur <number> fair assessment hai <end>
<begin> yeah i think joss whedon was a good choice for director also his vision was really inline with the comics <end>	<begin> haan mujhe lagta hai joss whedon director k liye acchi choice tha uski vision comics se milti hai <end>
<begin> well i cant speak for the comics havent read them but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories <end>	<begin> well main comics k baare me to nahi keh sakta nahi padha hu but ye movie sabhi heroes aur unke stories ka badhiya mashup hai <end>
<begin> i guess its just a very good movie with an amazing plot <end>	<begin> i guess ye ek acchi movie thi ek amazing plot k saath <end>
<begin> i agree <end>	<begin> main agree karta hu <end>
<begin> loki using clint barton to help him with the tesseract was awesome too i like him even though hes a bad guy <end>	<begin> taissairacht ke saath unakee madad karane ke lie loki ne klint baartan ka upayog kiya jo bahut hee bhayaanak tha main use pasand karata hoon bhale hee vah ek bura aadamee ho <end>
<begin> right that was a great scene <end>	<begin> sahee vah ek behatareen drshy tha <end>
<begin> lokis a likable villain id say <end>	<begin> loki ke ek yogy khalanaayak hai jo main kahata hoon <end>
<begin> it was interesting how it caused such a riff within the avengers thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie <end>	<begin> yah dilachasp tha ki avengers ke bheetar is tarah kee daraar kaise huee thor ko ab bhee aisa lag raha tha ki philm ke dauraan unhonne lambe samay tak unake prati vaphaadaaree kee hai <end>
<begin> you think <end>	<begin> aapako lagata hai <end>

<begin> do you think that was the best way for him to answer prayers through email <end>	<begin> kya is tarah ka prayers aap maanthe hon jaise email mein prayer send karna <end>
<begin> i agree i think the email system was less personal than how god would actually answer prayers in reality however at that point im sure he was overwhelmed how would you answer everyones prayers if you had to be god <end>	<begin> haan ab sabhi update hogaye tho kyon god bhi apne email system se kyon nahi chaleye however voh tho badi overwhelmed they kya voh saari prayers sunthe jaise god ke tarah <end>

<begin> just another affirmation that spielberg knew what he was doing even in post production <end>	<begin> ek dusra affirmation ki spielberg knew ki voh post production me kya kar raha tha <end>
<begin> do you usually like this type of movie <end>	<begin> kya aap aamataur par is tarah kee philm pasand karate hain <end>
<begin> no doubt he is very good at making movies no it is not my favorite kind i am not much into jump scares i like documentaries how about you <end>	<begin> isamen koee shak nahin vah philmen banaane mein bahut achchhe hain nahin yah meree pasandeeda kism nahin hai main bahut jyaada dara hua nahin hoon mujhe vrttachitr pasand hain aap kaise hain <end>
<begin> i like this type of movie around halloween otherwise i enjoy action films <end>	<begin> mujhe hailoveen ke aasapaas is tarah kee philm pasand hai anyatha mujhe ekshan philmon ka aanand milata hai <end>
<begin> that is understandable halloween is a good time to scare yourself <end>	<begin> yah samajh mein aata haihailoveen khud ko daraane ka ek achchha samay hai <end>
<begin> what did you think of the mayors reaction to the shark attack <end>	<begin> shaark ke hamale par meyar kee pratikriya ke baare mein aapane kya socha <end>
<begin> i think it was greedy i agree it is best not to panic the public but putting people in danger out of greed is not okay <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki yah laalachee thamain maanata hoon ki janata ko ghabaraana nahin chaahie lekin laalach se logon ko khatare mein daalana theek nahin hai <end>
<begin> exactly i thought it was neat to think of real world implications both fiscally and morally <end>	<begin> theek mainne socha tha ki vaastavik duniya ke nihitaarth ko naitik aur naitik roop se donon ke baare mein sochana saaph tha <end>
<begin> of how to present this to the public <end>	<begin> ise janata ke saamane kaise pesh kiya jae <end>
<begin> which in the end resulted in a shark hunting frenzy <end>	<begin> jisake parinaamasvaroop ant mein ek shaark shikaar unmaad paida hua <end>
<begin> i like to think of those things too i did not like that part i think i would have liked it better if the shark was led out to sea but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that not enough drama <end>	<begin> un cheejon ke baare mein bhee sochana pasand karate hainmujhe vah hissa pasand nahin thamujhe lagata hai ki shaark ko samudr tak le jaaya jaata to mujhe achchha lagata lekin jyaadaatar log shaayad us tarah kee philm ka aanand nahin lenge paryaapt naatak nahin <end>
<begin> you are right on that <end>	<begin> aap us par sahee hain <end>
<begin> it was nice to see characters such as brody step up though it took his son to go into shock in order to spur him to action <end>	<begin> brodee ke kadam jaise charitron ko dekhana achchha tha haalaanki isane unake bete ko kaarravaee ke lie prerit karane ke lie sadame mein le liya <end>
<begin> i think spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as portraying small town politics <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki speelabarg ne chhote shahar kee raajaneeti ko chitrit karane ke lie naakhoon par sir maara <end>
<begin> yes it was realistic though i think much of it applies to politics of all types <end>	<begin> haan yah yathaarthavaadee tha haalaanki mujhe lagata hai ki yah sabhee prakaar kee raajaneeti par laagoo hota hai <end>
<begin> money seems to always be highest priority <end>	<begin> paisa hamesha sarvochch praathamikata lagata hai <end>
<begin> unfortunately true <end>	<begin> durbhaagyavash yah sach hai <end>
<begin> and sadly we do not get galvanized to action sometimes until tragedy strikes <end>	<begin> aur dukh kee baat yah hai ki hamen traasadee ke hamalon tak kabhee kabhee kaarravaee ke lie jastee nahin milata hai <end>
<begin> have you seen other spielberg movies <end>	<begin> kya aapane any speelabarg philmen dekhee hain <end>
<begin> yes he has his shining moments and some duds along the way i feel that more of his movies fall into the former rather than latter category <end>	<begin> haan usake paas apane chamakadaar kshan aur raaste mein kuchh yugal hain mujhe lagata hai ki unakee adhik philmen baad kee shrenee ke bajaay poorv mein aatee hain <end>
<begin> you <end>	<begin> aap <end>
<begin> i know i have and that his movies are usually really well made but i cannot remember which movies are his i am very bad at stuff like that <end>	<begin> hey muje toh unka movies bahut pasand hein lakin unka movies muje yaad nahi aatha hein mein yaad karne me thoda kamjor hoon <end>
<begin> i did not like the scuba part i enjoy enjoy breathing <end>	<begin> muje toh voh scuba part bilkul pasand nahi hein magar voh breathing toh mein enjoy kar raha tha <end>

<begin> i enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well <end>	<begin> mujhe different type ke robot fighters movie me dekhne me pasand aye <end>
<begin> the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movies world <end>	<begin> naye paragraph se mujhe robot ke interesting factor ka pata chala is movie world ke <end>
<begin> like hes just a lower class dude but he owns a fighting robot <end>	<begin> woh ek lower class ladka hai par uske paas ek fighting robot hai <end>
<begin> yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that i really liked as well <end>	<begin> yeh dikh raha hai kaise woh world se draw hue hai aur kaise ye robots sirf ek common chiz hai jo mujhe pasand bhi hai <end>
<begin> i thought about what it would be like to really live in that world <end>	<begin> main ne socha ki kis tarah us world me jiya jata hoga <end>
<begin> also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesnt make all problems go away <end>	<begin> yeh kaafi interesting point ubharta hai ki improved technology se problems gaye nahi hain <end>
<begin> this guy still is in debt and so on <end>	<begin> ye ladka abhi bhi debt me hai and rahega <end>
<begin> yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change theyll just come about in a new way <end>	<begin> kuch bhi ho lekin life issues ko kabhi change nahi hote voh kahi new way mein aa hi jaatha <end>
<begin> that was a pretty good scene the new paragraph <end>	<begin> kaafi ache scene hein is new paragraph mein <end>
<begin> kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy son but eventually they fought their way back <end>	<begin> hint ke tarah hein kuch guy ka yaad aatha jo eventually aapas mein fought kiye the <end>
<begin> cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots <end>	<begin> cool he us robots ko human spirit se dekhne ka <end>

<begin> its just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way there will always be trials and triumphs <end>	<begin> yeh tho classic underdog story jo different way mein kaha gaya hein trials aur triumphs tho aathe jaathe hein <end>
<begin> as long as humans are around well never really intrinsically change <end>	<begin> jab tak humans aapas mein aathe tab tak hum kabhi intrinsically change nahi karte <end>
<begin> yeah the robots dont change the human life they just augment it <end>	<begin> haan robots tho human life ko nahi change karte yeh sirf augment hi hey <end>
<begin> nothing intrinsic is lost <end>	<begin> intrinsic tho kuch nahi hein <end>
<begin> right i suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans more so than the actual humans thats a really interesting concept i think <end>	<begin> sahi hei kahi log tho robots ko human ke tarah dekhne lagthe lekin actual humans tho behetar hein really interesting concept hein yar <end>
<begin> kinda reminds me of virtual reality <end>	<begin> virtual reality ka yaad aaya <end>
<begin> humanity lives on but through the robots <end>	<begin> humanity tho jinda rahega lekin robots <end>
<begin> even though the robots are doing the action their action is still fully human <end>	<begin> robots kitna bhi kaam karega lekin lagtha tho human ki tarah hi <end>

<begin> lol <end>	<begin> lol <end>
<begin> the movie maleficent is also a great look at the untold story of sleeping beauty <end>	<begin> movie maleficient bhi bahut achhi hain aur sleeping beauty ke ankaha kahani dekho <end>
<begin> yes its true <end>	<begin> han yeh sahi hai <end>

<begin> i think the new ones are excellent as well <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai new ones bhi bahut badiya hai <end>
<begin> so very true i just like the digital look of the fairytale setting that plays off the original animated scenery <end>	<begin> bilkul sahi mujhe fairytale setting ka digital look pasand hai jo original animated scenery dikhata hai <end>
<begin> are you a fan lf disney movies <end>	<begin> kya tum disney movies ke fan ho <end>
<begin> this movie did cause me to loathe king stefan though i mean he tore her wings off <end>	<begin> iss movie ne raja stefan ko kam karne ke liye kiya mera matlab usne apne wings kaat diye <end>
<begin> i like pirates of the caribbean more than all the other disney <end>	<begin> mujhe pirates of the caribbean sabhi disney movies se zyada pasand hai <end>
<begin> yes and no i find that the animated films are quite nostalgic but the live action films like maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the films cater better to me nowawdays <end>	<begin> han ye nhi mujhe lagta hai ki animated movies bahut nostalgic hoti hai lekin live action movies jaise maleficent jis mein tum film ke peechhe andhera dekh skte ho ajakl zyada behtar hai mere <end>
<begin> true i think you are a good movie reader <end>	<begin> sach mujhe lagta hai ki tum ek achhe movie reader ho <end>
<begin> though i do find the jerry burckheimer productions better than robert stromberg who did maleficent <end>	<begin> halanki mujhe jerry burckheimer productions better lagti hai robert stromberg jisne maleficent banayi thi <end>
<begin> yes you are correct <end>	<begin> han tum sahi ho <end>
<begin> but maleficent has a far more heartbreaking background than the pirates moviesthe background of maleficent and even the fact taht she cared for aurora despite her villian status makes her likeable and hateable at the same time <end>	<begin> but maleficent ka background zyada heartbreaking and pirate movies se maleficient ka background aur ye fact ki wo aurora ki care krti hai jabki uska ek villan ka status hote hue bhi use likeable or hateable dono ek hi samay pe banata hai <end>
<begin> which ones are your favorite movies animated or action <end>	<begin> tumhari konsi movies favorite hai animated ya action <end>
<begin> how many times have you seen this movie <end>	<begin> tumne yeh movie kitni baar dekhi hai <end>
<begin> i quite have not seen the whole movie <end>	<begin> maine yeh saari movie nhi dekhi <end>
<begin> i like the action ones best i think and ive only seen maleficent once while the storyline was great i am not complelled to watch it again <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe action sabse achhi lagti hai aur maine sirf ek baar maleficent dekhi hai jabki storyline bahut achhi thi main isse phir se nhi dekhna chahta <end>
<begin> yes me too <end>	<begin> han main bhi <end>
<begin> what parts have you seen <end>	<begin> tumne konse parts dekhe hai <end>
<begin> to be honest i dont really remember much <end>	<begin> sach kahu to mujhe zyada yaad nhi hai <end>
<begin> i mean i do give them credit for the live action of the whole phillip rescuing aurora from maleficent thing but even with computers and the live action none of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into the dragon <end>	<begin> mera matlab hai ki main use pure philip ki live action ke liye credit deta huin jo ki sirf maleficient ki cheezon se aurora ko bachate hain but yahan tak ki computers aur live action ke saath in mein se kisi ne bhi animated version ke saath justice nhi ki jahan wo dragon mein badal jati hai <end>
<begin> plus they added a darker element where king stefan also falls to his death <end>	<begin> unhone uske upar kala element add kiya uske vajahse raja stefan mar gaya <end>
<begin> well i do remember that part <end>	<begin> ha mujhe wo part yad hai <end>
<begin> are you into movies critics <end>	<begin> tum movie crtics ho kya <end>
<begin> i find this movie confuses me lol youre happy she gets her wings back but mad auroras dad died or is that good too he wasnt bad in the animated version <end>	<begin> mujhe ye movie confuse krti hai tum khush ki usko wings milte hai but paga aurora ke dad marte hai ya ye bhi acha hai wo bura nahi hai animated movie me <end>

<begin> no i usually like stuff with benedict cumberpatch though <end>	<begin> nahimain benedict cumberpatch jaise movie dekhtha hoon <end>
<begin> it was such a thrilling movie based on the life of alan turing <end>	<begin> woh bada romanchakari movie thawoh alan turing ke jeevan ke bare me tha <end>
<begin> keira knightly slightly annoys me however <end>	<begin> keira knightly mujeh achi nahi lagtha <end>
<begin> cumberbach was really the highlight of the film <end>	<begin> cumberbach film ke mukhya akarshan tha <end>
<begin> got good reviews rotten tomatoes rarely goes over <number> it seems <end>	<begin> acha sameekhan mila rotton tomatos ko <number> ke uper sameekshan nahi mila <end>
<begin> who is alan turing <end>	<begin> alan turing kaun hai <end>
<begin> true metacritic gave them <number> turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the british during wwii against the germans he is famous for breaking the enigma code <end>	<begin> sach hein yar metacritic ne <number> diya tha turing toh mathematician hein jo british ke liye cryptanalyst bane the tab wwii saari germans ke against the aur voh enigma code ko break karne mein famous hein <end>
<begin> he was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home <end>	<begin> voh toh spy the aur police ke liye investigate kar rahe the jo unka ghar break hogaya tha <end>
<begin> definitely see it if you get a chance <end>	<begin> jarur dekh na agar aapko chance mila toh <end>
<begin> dramas tend to kind of bore me usually with many note worthy exceptions i like comedies mostly or fantasy sci fi i will check it out though all in all i just love movies <end>	<begin> voh drama toh bore lagne laga usme jyada note worthy exceptions tha muje comedies aur fantasy pasand aaya especially sci fi mein check kar lunga overall muje movies pasand hein <end>
<begin> sounds like an interesting fellow will definetly give it a watch <end>	<begin> lagtha hein interest se rahega jarur mein watch karunga <end>
<begin> it is really more of an espionage movie it is pretty exciting i guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom his mentor <end>	<begin> han yar yeh toh espionage movie nikla bahut excite hein usme muje lagtha hein ki usme kuch drama apni boarding school ka experiences mein se likha hoga aur morcom mein padne se likha hoga jo uska mentor tha <end>
<begin> i think you will enjoy it <end>	<begin> muje laga ki tu enjoy karega <end>
<begin> morton tyldum is a great director <end>	<begin> morton tyldum bahut badiya director hein <end>
<begin> andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right if he liked it i will probably hate it <end>	<begin> voh andrew grant aur uska rag science ka news kabhi bhi right nahi hota agar voh ushe pasand aaya tho mein use hate karunga <end>
<begin> the hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of cumberpatch as i am <end>	<begin> voh hollywood reporter toh cumberpatch nikhla jaisa mein hoon <end>
<begin> it is kind of technical it goes pretty in depth about his machine to break the code he has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows you will probably enjoy that <end>	<begin> ye technical type ka hai code break karne ke liye machine me bahut deep jana padta hai use ek breakthrough milta hai jab use ye realize hota hai ki wo use pahle se malulm words se wo is program kar sakta hai tum enjoy karoge ise <end>
<begin> cumberbach does a great job acting <end>	<begin> kamal ki acting ki hai cumberbach ne <end>
<begin> these storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion <end>	<begin> mere opinion me true stories pe based ye story hamesha history ko distort karti hain use interesting banane ke liye <end>
<begin> the bit about getting married to keira knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting i might warn you about all that <end>	<begin> keira knightley se marriage ko lekar jo wakya hai wo thoda annoying hai agar aap uski acting ko leke thode favorable nahi hai to tumhe iske bare me warn kar raha hu <end>
<begin> it is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life i see your point there <end>	<begin> interesting baat ye hai ki yah movie us play par based hai jo uski life par likhi book par based hai tumhara point dekh sakta hu mai <end>
<begin> i would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film the good acting and even the half made up story <end>	<begin> mai probably film ke technical aspect ko enjoy karu badhiya acting aur half cooked story <end>
<begin> i think also where it is a movie about a mathematician it kind of helps to add in some plot elements i think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting <end>	<begin> i think also yah movie ek mathematician ke baare men hai plot me thode elements dalna helpful hai par mujhe ye unusual laga kyonki uski life to waise hi itni interesting hai <end>
<begin> there is quite a bit of espionage involved as well i suppose i am not spoiling it since it is history but there is some russian collusion involved <end>	<begin> isme espionage ka angle bhi involve hai i suppose mai kuch spoil nahi kar raha hu kyonki ye history hai but kuch russian secret bhi involved hai <end>
<begin> if he marries keira knightly i may be shouting at my tv <end>	<begin> agar wo keira knightly se marriage karega to mai shayad tv par hi shout karne lagu <end>
<begin> big drama when turing confronts the russians <end>	<begin> bada drama hua jab turning russians ko confront karta hai <end>
<begin> yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance it is not so bad though <end>	<begin> haan aapako phurteela romaans ke maadhyam se aage badhana hoga yah haalaanki itana bura nahin hai <end>
<begin> she is trite absolutely but the director does make it work here <end>	<begin> vah bilkul trait hai lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain <end>
<begin> also turns out he is gay <end>	<begin> yah bhee pata chala ki vah samalaingik hai <end>
<begin> so she gets what she deserves <end>	<begin> isalie use vah milata hai jisaka vah hakadaar hai <end>
<begin> you might actualy like it <end>	<begin> aap ise pasand kar sakate hain <end>
<begin> i didnt really get that part but who can understand the gays <end>	<begin> mujhe vaastav mein vah hissa nahin mila lekin samalaingikon ko kaun samajh sakata hai <end>
<begin> well that kinda of makes it more inviting to me keira nightly must be sad to find that out <end>	<begin> khair yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie <end>
<begin> yeah i think she was pretty upset like i said i didnt really understand all of that i was mostly in it for the math what an interesting fascinating story <end>	<begin> haan mujhe lagata hai ki vah bahut pareshaan thee jaisa mainne kaha ki main vaastav mein us sab ko samajh nahin paaya hoon main jyaadaatar ganit ke lie isamen tha kya dilachasp aakarshak kahaanee hai <end>
<begin> i think turing was gay for his mentor or something but he dies <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki tyooring apane guru ya kuchh aur ke lie samalaingik tha lekin vah mar jaata hai <end>
<begin> sounds a bit like beautiful mind that was a great movie too <end>	<begin> sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee bhee <end>
<begin> tuberculosis <end>	<begin> tuberculosis <end>
<begin> yeah i did love beautiful mind i read that that guy actually was working for the government <end>	<begin> haan beautiful mind accha lagamaine padha hai woh government main kaam karta tha <end>
<begin> talk about changing the story <end>	<begin> story badalne ke baare main batao <end>
<begin> turings story is pretty sad he got bullied a lot at boarding school seems to have affected him a lot too bad he wasnt able to find love maybe he should have gone for somebody besides kiera knightley <end>	<begin> turing ki story bahut sad hai usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gayalagta hai woh bahut affect hua too bad use love nahin mila maybe use kiera knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha <end>
<begin> how come you dislike her so much <end>	<begin> kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho <end>
<begin> is it because you guys used to date <end>	<begin> kya isliye ki tum log dating karte the <end>
<begin> mostly just for hogging that driftwood in titanic <end>	<begin> mostly driftwood ke hogging ke liye titanic mein <end>
<begin> oh yeah i have never seen that one <end>	<begin> oh haan maine kabhi nahin dekha tha usko <end>
<begin> i find her wiry trite and egotistical i only enjoy those qualities in myself <end>	<begin> mujhe woh wirytrite aur egotistical laga mujhe sirf who qualities apne mein lagta hai <end>
<begin> i know there is that song by celine dion <end>	<begin> mujhe malum hai woh song celine dion se hai <end>
<begin> haha that is funny i figured that but didnt want to say <end>	<begin> ha bahut hi majedar hai hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete <end>
<begin> she is kind of a walking plattitude kind of like reese witherspoon but more indiana less texas <end>	<begin> woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai reese witherspoon ki tarah lekin jyada indiana aur kum texas <end>
<begin> or something <end>	<begin> ya kuch kuch <end>
<begin> oh its ok im not blind however after looking at keira knightley for <number> hours i might be <end>	<begin> arey teek hai hum andha nahi hai lekin do ghante tak hum keira knightly ko dekhne ke badh ho sakta hai <end>
<begin> still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told ill have to tune in <end>	<begin> phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye humko sunna padega <end>
<begin> anyways she didnt ruin the movie if anything turings life ruins the movie its just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love he could have just worked out made some friends and been happy it is a very important story reminds me of the life of charles darwin or plato <end>	<begin> vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai woh kam kar sakta tha kuch dost bana sakta tha aur khush reha sakta tha yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai charles darwin ya plato ka yad dilata hai <end>
<begin> oh i really like reese not sure what that says about me <end>	<begin> arre mujhe vastavme reez pasand hai lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai <end>
<begin> that is funny but you dont like kiera <end>	<begin> yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko kiera pasand nahi hai <end>
<begin> i thought cumberbach made a great turing but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem <end>	<begin> mujhe laga ki cumberbakh ne ek mahan turing banaya hai agar woh eminem dalte hai to aur hi majedar hota <end>
<begin> fitness is very important im a big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story <end>	<begin> fitness bahut jaruri hai mi darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi <end>
<begin> well darwin had a rough time on the beagle he was the captains special steward which was a demanding job if you know what i mean <end>	<begin> kunaa daarvin ko beegal par ek kathin samay tha vah kaptaan ke khaas steward tha jo ek maangalik kaary tha yadi tumhen maaloom hai ki mera kya matalab hai <end>
<begin> all of the hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it <end>	<begin> sabhee holeevud raigs isake baare mein bahut jyaada bolate the <end>
<begin> his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life he was certainly an interesting fellow <end>	<begin> phitanes ka unaka siddhaant mool roop se kaptaan aur jeevan mein unake steshan ke lie unake rishte ka ek saadrshy tha aur apane jeevan mein ek uchch steshan ke lie vikaas kee usakee bhaavana vah nishchit roop se ek dilachasp saathee tha <end>
<begin> i seriously loved this turing movie you have to see it <end>	<begin> mujhe yah tyooring philm bahut pasand aaee aapako ise dekhana hee hoga <end>
<begin> i dont usually take anything the hollywood reporter says to heart though <end>	<begin> main aamataur par hollywood riportar ko dil se kahata hai ki kuchh bhee mat lo <end>
<begin> no they have their own problems <end>	<begin> nahin unakee apanee samasyaen nahin hain <end>
<begin> and what do they know about science <end>	<begin> aur ve vigyaan ke baare mein kya jaanate hain <end>
<begin> not since they gave the big lebowski such awful reviews <end>	<begin> nahin jab se unhonne da big lebovskee ko aisee bhayaanak sameeksha dee <end>
<begin> turing is an important guy id rather see a movie about kurt godel or giordano bruno <end>	<begin> tyooring ek mahatvapoorn ladaka hai balki main kart godel ya jiyordaano broono ke baare mein ek philm dekhoonga <end>
<begin> or maybe a serious horror drama about galileo <end>	<begin> ya shaayad gaileeliyo ke baare mein ek gambheer horar naatak <end>
<begin> i think the big lebowski was a great film i didnt realize it had a poor critical reception <end>	<begin> mere vichar se big lebowski great film thi mujhe nahi maloom tha ki ise poor critical reception mila <end>
<begin> i actually think i might write a script about the life of galileo <end>	<begin> me actually sochta hu ki mujhe galileo ki life ke bare me ek script likhna chahiye <end>
<begin> your right because scientifically the big lebowski is the best movie ever made yet magazines like empire and variety peed on its rug <end>	<begin> tum right ho kyunki scientifically big lebowski aaj tak banayi gayi best film he iske bawajood empire aur variety jaisi magazines iski apman janak alochna karti he <end>
<begin> people would love that it would make them feel smart <end>	<begin> people pasand karenge ki ye unhe smart feel karayega <end>
<begin> actually that makes sense <end>	<begin> actually ye mayne rakhta he <end>
<begin> i am actually ordained as a dudist priest <end>	<begin> me actually dudist priest ke rup me jana jata hu <end>
<begin> you can do it online for free and then you can legally marry people <end>	<begin> tum ise online free me kar sakte ho aur uske bad tum legally kisi se bhi marriage kar sakte ho <end>

<begin> what is up with this study though i feel we are being watched do you think we will be in a movie with benjamin cumberbach <end>	<begin> haalaanki is adhyayan ke saath kya ho raha hai mujhe lagata hai ki hamen dekha ja raha hai kya aapako lagata hai ki ham benjaamin kambarabaich ke saath ek philm mein honge <end>
<begin> i will for sure check it out on the myface <end>	<begin> main nishchit roop se ise myfachai par dekhoonga <end>
<begin> i think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki myfachai aur spachaibook naamak samaanaantar netavark hona chaahie <end>
<begin> haha i use that term myface all the time <end>	<begin> hah ki main har samay myfachai shabd ka upayog karata hoon <end>
<begin> great minds think alike <end>	<begin> bade man vaale aisa sochate hain <end>
<begin> i once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstars <end>	<begin> mainne ek baar dankin bakestaar naamak ek kophee kee dukaan kholane ke vichaar ke saath khilavaad kiya <end>
<begin> but yes they say iron knows iron <end>	<begin> lekin haan ve kahate hain ki loha lohe ko jaanata hai <end>
<begin> it said there would be three pages yet we seem to be done <end>	<begin> isane kaha ki teen pej honge phir bhee ham aisa karate prateet hote hain <end>
<begin> anyways though it is pretty exciting to see turing recalibrate that machine you will enjoy that <end>	<begin> vaise bhee us masheen ko tyooring reekailibret dekhana kaaphee romaanchak hai aapako maja aaega <end>

<begin> <number> is a fair rating i felt that this movie was excellent but somewhat heady i could see why it isnt everyones cup of tea what rating would you give inception <end>	<begin> <number> fair rating he mujhe laga ki ye movie excellent he but somewhat heady heme dekh sakta hu ki kyu ye everyone ka cup of tea hetum inception ko kya rating dete <end>
<begin> i agree <number> seems fair <end>	<begin> me agree hu <number> fair lagti he <end>
<begin> there were some interesting characters in this movie what character did you relate to most <end>	<begin> is movie me kuch interesting character thekis character se tum sabse adhik relate karte ho <end>
<begin> leonardo dicaprio was compelling in the role of dom the inception seems like a tailor fit role for dicaprio i enjoyed his performance but found that the plot was so inventive that i had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters it seemed too divorced from reality <end>	<begin> leonardo dicaprio dom ke role me compelling thathe inception ka role lagta he ki dicaprio ke liye tailor fit role thamene uska performance enjoy kiya but mujhe laga ki role itna inventive tha ki kis bhi character se directly relate karna mere liye hard he <end>
<begin> did this movie make you ponder the origins of your own thoughts <end>	<begin> kya is movie ne tumhe tumhari soch ke baare mein sochne pe majboor kiya <end>
<begin> well it was interesting to say the least the idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure <end>	<begin> well kam bolna interesting tha kisi dusre ke subconscious mein kuch plant karne ke idea nei mujhe sure kar diya <end>
<begin> it was pretty out there <end>	<begin> bahar bahut sunder h <end>
<begin> do you like scientific movies <end>	<begin> kya tumhe scientific movies h <end>
<begin> i adore them the more out there the better <end>	<begin> i unse pyar h bahar bahut better h <end>
<begin> did you notice the complexity of the dreamscapes in the movie i thought it was very inventive <end>	<begin> kya tumne movie mein dreamscapes ki complexity ko notice kiya mujhe laga yaha bahut inventive h <end>
<begin> im having a hard time recalling some of the specifics its hard to believe this film is almost <number> years old already i do recall them growing increasingly more complex and dream like the deeper they went though <end>	<begin> mujhe kuch specific yaad nai aa rahi h yaha believe karna mushkil h ki yaha movie <number> saal purani h mujhe yaad aa raha h ki yaha din b din complex and dream like ho rhi h <end>
<begin> did you notice in each dream there was a kick <end>	<begin> kya tune notice kiya ki har ek dream mein ek kick h <end>
<begin> i did i loved it it was like a dreamy rube goldberg contraption <end>	<begin> maine kiya yaha mujhe pasand h yaha dremy rube goldberg contraption ki tarah h <end>
<begin> can you imagine yourself in a similar scenario they must have had a tremendous amount of trust for each other if anything went wrong they could have ended up in limbo <end>	<begin> kya tum apne aap ko same scenario mein imagine kar sakte ho unme bahut jyada trust hona chahiye yadi kuch bhi wrong hota h to wo limlbe mein khatm ho sakta h <end>
<begin> i couldnt imagine it sounds very risky especially if the dreamer dies in the dream before the sedative wears off <end>	<begin> mein imagine bhi nahi saktha voh toh badi risky sound kartha expecially voh dreamer apna dream mein hi mar jaatha uska sedative wear karne ke pehle hi <end>
<begin> if the dreamer died and you end up in limbo where do you think that is all of the extractors are living within that consciousness what would become of them since if he dies that consciousness will cease to exist <end>	<begin> agar dreamer mar gaya toh limbo mein end hotha kaise aise kar sakthe sabhi extractors issi consciousness mein hi jee rahe hein kya yeb sab ban baayenge <end>
<begin> good question and very thought provoking in the movie they just went into limbo but i suppose the subconscious dreams would have to adjust to fit the new scenario it would be scary to have the possibility of forgetting that you are in a dream at all do you think it would be worth the potential setback <end>	<begin> ache question kaafi provoking thought hein is movie mein voh limbo ke liye gaye hein kyon ki mein subconscious dream par is scenario ko nahi mil paatha bahut scary dream hein kya aap ko is potential setback ke baare mein kya haal chaal hein <end>
<begin> i think that possibility is much greater than a setback i took it to mean that all the extractors as well as the subject would be trapped forever in that way it seems much too risky the aim is to plant an idea in someones mind without their realizing it almost like mind control i think it would me much easier and less risky to sit and negotiate with someone although thats not at all subversive <end>	<begin> muje lagtha hein ki is setback thoda jyada hein muje lagtha hein ki sabhi extractors ko is subject ko trapped kiye gaye hein is tarah mein toh yeh jyada risky nazar aa raha hein uska aim ka plant toh koi dusri ka idea hoga jo koi mind control kiya hein mein soch raha hun ki voh jyada easier ho tha aur risky bhi kam hota aur negotiate bhi kar sakthe magar sab koi subversive nahi hote <end>
<begin> good point what did you think about what happened to mal <end>	<begin> ache point hein toh aap us mal ko kya huva <end>
<begin> mals conflict is pivotal to this film for all the layers of intrigue we have diving down into the dreams of the target mals actions plant the idea in our minds that there could be many layers above as well is the reality we began this film in reality at all what do you think <end>	<begin> mal ka conflick is film mein pivotal hein toh sabhi intrigue ko is dream ka target diving hota hein mals ka action plant ka idea toh badi layers hein reality mein toh is film thoda jyada hi reality ho gaya kya aap kya sochte hein <end>
<begin> reality as we know it can be hard if there was an alternate reality available that was more enjoyable i could see where mal would want to believe it was the real reality the dreams would have to be extremely detailed and believable to be that convinced since mal committed suicide to attempt to wake up for real i assume the beginning reality was the real one do you think cobb should face murder charges for mals death <end>	<begin> hakikath mein toh jeena thoda kasth hein agar koi alternate reality hein toh maja aatha muje toh us mal ko reality mein believe hi nahi hota uska dream toh badi detailed aur believable thi ki koi convinced ho saktha agar mal suicide karne ka dream aatha jab utne se toh mein reality par believe karte kya cobb ko mals ka murder charges lagane ka faisla thik tha <end>
<begin> absolutely not the audience knows the real truth <end>	<begin> bilkul nahi yar audience ko sach patha hota hei <end>
<begin> i tend to agree <end>	<begin> mein bhi agree karunga <end>
<begin> its a good thing ariadne had the kick setup for fischer to wake up <end>	<begin> yeh sabhi baath hein ki ariadne ko us fisher ne acha kick setup kiya jab wake up hote par <end>
<begin> it is a good thing they didnt get trapped memories of a dying parent would be very strong would a new memory like this make you change your life <end>	<begin> yeh acchi baat hai ki pakde nahi gaye marte huye parents ki memories bohot strong hoti hai kya aise ek nayi memory tumhe apni life change karne par majbor karegi <end>
<begin> i think it would i would want to honor my dying parents requests how about you <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai ha mai apne marte huye parents ki iccha zarur puri karunga tum <end>
<begin> i would too would you stay in a dream forever if it were the reality you loved <end>	<begin> mai bhi kya tum humesha k liye ek dream me rahoge agar tumhe reality pasand ho <end>
<begin> it would certainly be tempting how odd would it be to know you are in a dream yet you are getting older living a whole life waking up youd be much younger then in the dream do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it is the actual reality <end>	<begin> bohot tempting hoga wo tumhe kaisa lagega yeh jaan k ki bhale hi tum ek dream me ho par phir bhi tum age kar rahe aur ek life ji rahe jab jagoge toh tum bohot young hoge dream me tumhe lagta hai yeh yakeen karna mushkil hoga actual reality <end>
<begin> well it depends im growing older right now but i believe this is reality id certainly be happy to die but then wake up a younger man but i have no difficulty believing this is reality because i dont know any better right now if i did know this was a dream id be happy to stay here because id get to live a whole extra life before my next what would you do <end>	<begin> waise it depends mai abhi budha ho raha aur mujhe lagta hai yeh reality hai mujhe waise yeh sahi me accha lagega agar mai maru aur phir se zinda jab hou tab young ho jau waise mujhe yeh manne me koi pareshaani nahi ki yeh sacchai hai kuiki mujhe isse better kuch pata nahi hai agar yeh ek sapna hai toh mai yaha rehna chachunga kyuki jab mai jagunga toh mujhe ek extra life jeene ko milegi tum kya sochate ho <end>
<begin> honestly im not sure but i think it would make my mind play trick on me wait i just lived my life how can i now be in a different one it would definitely hard to grasp <end>	<begin> mujhe pata nahi par mujhe yeh zarur lagta hai ki mera mind itna bada dhokha nahi karega mere saath maine ek jeevan jiya ek aur kaise ji sakta mai bohot pareshaani hogi yakeen karne me <end>
<begin> what did you think of the spinning top totem <end>	<begin> tum kya sochate ho spinning top totem k baare me <end>
<begin> i thought it was the perfect cinematic device the spinning creates so much anticipation for what comes next will it fall over wont it puts you on the edge of your seat <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai wo ek perfect cinematic device hai jo spinning hai wo itna excitement create karti ki ab next kya hoga kya hoga agar sab bigad gaya bohot hi zyada thrill <end>
<begin> what kind of totem do you think you would have <end>	<begin> tum kis type ka totem pasand karoge <end>
<begin> i think an eight ball would be exciting and create anticipation <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai eight ball accha hoga aur anticipation create karega <end>
<begin> have you seen the original toy story <end>	<begin> kya tumne original toy story dekhi hai <end>

<begin> we are here to discuss batman vs superman dawn of justice <end>	<begin> hum yaha batman vs superman yaani dawn of justice ke baare mein discuss karenge <end>
<begin> yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of <end>	<begin> haan muje characters se familiar hoon lekin kuch actors ko nahi patha hein <end>
<begin> i think it sounds like an amazing movie i love superheroes i think some of the critics are too harsh it was a good plot line i am familiar with ben affleck but none of the others <end>	<begin> mein kya soch rahi thi ki yeh amazing movies ke tarah sound kartha muje superheroes bahut pasan dhein muje lagtha hein ki critics thoda harsh hein yeh ache plot line hein muje ben affleck se kuch familiar hoon lekin dusra muje nahi patha <end>
<begin> i wish they would have used more famous people <end>	<begin> agar voh aur thoda famous logo ko use kar sakthe they <end>
<begin> i would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel the plot line of that was amazing <end>	<begin> mein bhi maantha hoon ki voh ache nahi hein us man of steel ke tarah plot line tho amazing hein <end>
<begin> ben affleck is the only actor i recognize great plot very harsh critcs <end>	<begin> sirf ben affleck hi yek actor jo ache tarah recognize kiya jo harsh critcs se <end>
<begin> i agree i didnt completely understand why batman and superman fought though <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon muje yeh understand nahi hota ki kyon batman aur superman aapas mein fight karthe <end>
<begin> rotten tomatoes list it as <number> and average with a <number> out of <number> the critcs must be weird yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad <end>	<begin> rotten tomatoes neh <number> di aur uska average tho <number> <number> tha critics tho weird hein haan muje bhi is fight ko figure out nahi kar paa raha hoon lekin kuch samaj aarahi hein ki kyonki superman ko acceidentally bruce wayne ka dad maar daala <end>
<begin> i thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than <number> that seemed low that makes sense i would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members <end>	<begin> muje laga ki yeh worth meteroitic score <number> ke se upper hein lekin low nikla mein tho mad hota agar koi mera family ko aise koi maar dethe <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>
<begin> yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of lex luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie i like how the critic talked about lex who is supermans arch enemy because he compared him to the joker and riddler who are batmans arch enemies <end>	<begin> yeh tho unique spin hey lex luthor ka character ko jo whole movies mein nazar aathe muje tho unka bol pasand hein jaise critic ko lex ke saath bola kyon ki dono aapas me compared kar rahe the ki kon joker aur riddler hein <end>
<begin> then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to mark zuckerburg <end>	<begin> fir donon compare karthe karthe crazy hote aur mark zuckerburg tak pahun jaathe <end>
<begin> ohh i liked that too i like how they always try to biring in the government official s <end>	<begin> acha muje bhi pasand hein muje tho voh pasand hein jab government official ko yaha laane ke try kar rahe they <end>
<begin> yeah im still here just slow typer <end>	<begin> haan mein yahi hi hoon mein thoda slow typer hoon <end>

<begin> actually superman <end>	<begin> actually superman <end>
<begin> how bout u <end>	<begin> thera kya soch hai <end>

<begin> i love batman <end>	<begin> mujhe batman pasand hai <end>
<begin> he is so mysterious <end>	<begin> wo bohuth ysterious hai <end>
<begin> sorta ironic that they become enemies <end>	<begin> ye ironic hai ki wo dushman ban gaye <end>
<begin> yes he is very mysterious <end>	<begin> haan wo mysterious hai <end>
<begin> it is its not what i expected at all <end>	<begin> ye hai jo maine expect kiya tha who ye nahi hai <end>
<begin> i expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together <end>	<begin> main ise kuch avengers ke jaise expect kiya that jis may kuch heroes saath mai kaam karthe hai <end>
<begin> i dont really like that they are enimies <end>	<begin> way dusman hai ye mujhe bilkul pasand nahi hain <end>
<begin> especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman <end>	<begin> khas kar ke jab batman superman ko marne wala tha <end>
<begin> me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles <end>	<begin> main bhi but superman ne ye starty kiya article me clark kent bruce wayna aur batman ko bura dikhane ki koshish kar raha hai <end>
<begin> you know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies <end>	<begin> tum jaante ho to be honest agar duniya ko aise dekhoge jaise abhi hai to unka dushman hona makes perfect sense <end>
<begin> i guess so they do have polar opposite personalities one is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive <end>	<begin> i guess so unki bilkul polar opposite personalities hai ek to humble farm boy hai dusra ek rich executive <end>
<begin> i could see why they clash in that aspect but i guess i dont imagine them interacting very much in superhero world <end>	<begin> main dekh sakta hu ke us aspect me kyu clash karege but main superhero world me jyada interact karte hue imagine nahi karta <end>
<begin> it says in the rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman <end>	<begin> aisa bolte hai ke rd part me superman ke funeral k dauran bruce lois lane se maafi mangta hai ye bolte hue k he failed superman <end>
<begin> duuhhhh well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol <end>	<begin> duhhhhh well han agar tumne use maar diya matlab you failed him lol <end>
<begin> i would feel like if i failed someone if i let them die too haha i like the mysterious dirt levitating though <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi aisa lagega k i failed someone agar maine unhe marne diya haha mujhe dhool ka mysterious levitate karna accha laga <end>
<begin> haha <end>	<begin> haha <end>
<begin> thats what i was thinking <end>	<begin> main bhi yahi soch raha hai <end>
<begin> little humor there <end>	<begin> thoda humor waha <end>
<begin> have u seen this movie <end>	<begin> tumne movie dekhi hai <end>
<begin> no have you is that the end <end>	<begin> no have you woh end hai kya <end>
<begin> i cant tell <end>	<begin> bata nahi sakta <end>
<begin> oh yeah it is <end>	<begin> arre haan it is <end>
<begin> i wonder if there will be a sequel <end>	<begin> uska seqeul hoga kya i wonder <end>
<begin> yes watched it <number> times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies <end>	<begin> haan maine teen baar dekhi its a tearjerker for me jab superman marta hai <end>
<begin> i feel like good superhero movies need sequels <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai acchi superhero movies ke sequel hone chahiye <end>
<begin> i dunno could be a sequel <end>	<begin> could be a sequel pata nahi mujhe <end>
<begin> like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman <end>	<begin> jaise superman asliyat mein mara nahi tha usne bas hibernate kiya tha til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman <end>
<begin> hi <end>	<begin> hi <end>

<begin> not sure its that good it has a score of <number> on rotten tomatoes <end>	<begin> sayad utni achi na ho rottten tomatoes ne ieshe <number> score diye hai <end>
<begin> thats what i was thinking also <end>	<begin> mai bhi yahi soch ta hu <end>
<begin> actually i kind of like sci fi but im picky <end>	<begin> vaise mai sci fi pasand karta hu lakin mai picky hu <end>
<begin> yes i can agree with that it depends for me <end>	<begin> mai isse agree kar sakta hu yah mujh par bhi depend karta hai <end>
<begin> this one sounds more like an action flick in a sci fi setting <end>	<begin> ish moive ki sound like action flick jaise hai <end>
<begin> ah that would make sense <end>	<begin> wah ye yek bat hai <end>
<begin> it also has sports <end>	<begin> yeh sports ka hein <end>
<begin> i thought more sci fi because it was also a twilight zone episode <end>	<begin> scifi ka kyon ki isme twilight zone ka episode bhi hein <end>
<begin> but the rocky with robots line makes me doubt that i would like it <end>	<begin> lekin rocky with robots tho muje doubt hein <end>
<begin> i didnt catch that but im with you <end>	<begin> muje kuch samaj nahi aaya lekin mein samajne ke koshish karunga <end>
<begin> ive never seen any rockys either <end>	<begin> rocky tho mein kahi dekha nahi hein <end>
<begin> and i didnt know it was a twilight zone episode <end>	<begin> aur muje twilight zone episode ke baare mein tho kuch patha nahi hein <end>
<begin> ha me neither havent seen the rocky movies <end>	<begin> muje bhi rocky movies dekha nahi hey <end>
<begin> thats kind of odd to me i feel like most everyone has seen them <end>	<begin> kuch off hein mere liye kyon ki agar koi kuch aise puche <end>
<begin> the premise of this one is not so stupid though robot boxers i feel it could become real at some point <end>	<begin> iska premise bhi itna stupid bhi nahi hein robot tho boxers hein muje tho real ke tarah feel huva us point mein <end>
<begin> rocky yeah i know it was such a big movie <end>	<begin> rocky haan muje patha hein kitna big movie hein <end>
<begin> but stallone has never done anything for me <end>	<begin> but stallone ne mere liye kuch nahi kiya <end>
<begin> no kidding i dont like any movies of his <end>	<begin> mujhe uski koi bhi movie pasand nahi hai <end>
<begin> this real steel movie has hugh jackman in it hes not b ad <end>	<begin> real steel movie mei hugh jackman haivah bura nahi hai <end>
<begin> but i dont mind hugh jackman <end>	<begin> but mei hugh jackman ko bura nahi manata <end>
<begin> haha were thinking the same thing <end>	<begin> hahaha ham sab ek hee baat ke bare mei soch rahe hai <end>

<begin> and hes better looking haha <end>	<begin> par vash achcha dikha raha hai <end>
<begin> not difficult <end>	<begin> difficult nahi hai <end>
<begin> were losing track of real steel though <end>	<begin> ham real steel ke track ko lose kar rahe hai <end>
<begin> it sounds as though this is pretty predictable as well and i like movies that i cant guess the end <end>	<begin> mujhe movie pasand hai jiska end guess nahi kar sakateuska sound thoda predictable hai <end>
<begin> the whole real steel story seems like a series of machinations of bad guys against good guys without much else <end>	<begin> real steel ka story tho series of machination us bad guys jo good guys se agains hein <end>
<begin> same here this one sounds like its been writ ten by committee <end>	<begin> same yar kuch commitee ke tarah sounds kartha <end>

<begin> yeah maybe its ok for kids they like the predictable storylines <end>	<begin> haan maybe yeh kids ke liye tho ok hein predictable storyline hein <end>
<begin> well not little but grade school <end>	<begin> well little tho nahi lekin grade school <end>

<begin> yes but he played it well and was able to pull it off <end>	<begin> haan voh ache play kiya hein <end>
<begin> yeah he played the struggle of the character well <end>	<begin> haan voh is character se ache struggle kiya hein <end>
<begin> i always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into i think he fit in with everyone else really well <end>	<begin> mujhe always interesting lagta hai dekhne me ki actor ki demands kaha tak pahuch sakti hai i think wo baki sabhi ke sath badhiya fit hua <end>
<begin> yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture <end>	<begin> yes actors ka unusual mix ki wajah se coherent mixture ban gaya <end>
<begin> thats definitley true <end>	<begin> ye to definitely true hai <end>
<begin> i enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well <end>	<begin> maine enjoy kiya movie me un sabhi different robot fighters ko bhi <end>
<begin> the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movies world <end>	<begin> jo paragraph load hu usne mujhe remind karaya ki ki ye kitna interesting factor tha movie me ki ye robots us movie world me everyday object the <end>
<begin> like hes just a lower class dude but he owns a fighting robot <end>	<begin> like wo just ek lower class dude tha but wo ek fighting robot own karta hai <end>

<begin> i thought about what it would be like to really live in that world <end>	<begin> i thought about ki really us world me rahne me kaisa lagta hoga <end>
<begin> also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesnt make all problems go away <end>	<begin> also ye bhi interesting point tha ki kaise sirf improved technology is duniya ki saari problems ko whisk away nahi kar sakti <end>
<begin> this guy still is in debt and so on <end>	<begin> ye guy still debt me tha aur so on <end>
<begin> yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change theyll just come about in a new way <end>	<begin> kuch bhi ho lekin life issues ko kabhi change nahi hote voh kahi new way mein aa hi jaatha <end>

<begin> nothing intrinsic is lost <end>	<begin> intrinsic tho kuch nahi hein <end>
<begin> right i suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans more so than the actual humans thats a really interesting concept i think <end>	<begin> sahi hei kahi log tho robots ko human ke tarah dekhne lagthe lekin actual humans tho behetar hein really interesting concept hein yar <end>
<begin> kinda reminds me of virtual reality <end>	<begin> virtual reality ka yaad aaya <end>

<begin> she is trite absolutely but the director does make it work here <end>	<begin> vah bilkul trait hai lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain <end>
<begin> also turns out he is gay <end>	<begin> yah bhee pata chala ki vah samalaingik hai <end>
<begin> so she gets what she deserves <end>	<begin> isalie use vah milata hai jisaka vah hakadaar hai <end>
<begin> you might actualy like it <end>	<begin> aap ise pasand kar sakate hain <end>
<begin> i didnt really get that part but who can understand the gays <end>	<begin> mujhe vaastav mein vah hissa nahin mila lekin samalaingikon ko kaun samajh sakata hai <end>
<begin> well that kinda of makes it more inviting to me keira nightly must be sad to find that out <end>	<begin> khair yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie <end>
<begin> yeah i think she was pretty upset like i said i didnt really understand all of that i was mostly in it for the math what an interesting fascinating story <end>	<begin> haan mujhe lagata hai ki vah bahut pareshaan thee jaisa mainne kaha ki main vaastav mein us sab ko samajh nahin paaya hoon main jyaadaatar ganit ke lie isamen tha kya dilachasp aakarshak kahaanee hai <end>
<begin> i think turing was gay for his mentor or something but he dies <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki tyooring apane guru ya kuchh aur ke lie samalaingik tha lekin vah mar jaata hai <end>
<begin> sounds a bit like beautiful mind that was a great movie too <end>	<begin> sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee bhee <end>
<begin> tuberculosis <end>	<begin> tuberculosis <end>
<begin> yeah i did love beautiful mind i read that that guy actually was working for the government <end>	<begin> haan beautiful mind accha lagamaine padha hai woh government main kaam karta tha <end>
<begin> talk about changing the story <end>	<begin> story badalne ke baare main batao <end>
<begin> turings story is pretty sad he got bullied a lot at boarding school seems to have affected him a lot too bad he wasnt able to find love maybe he should have gone for somebody besides kiera knightley <end>	<begin> turing ki story bahut sad hai usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gayalagta hai woh bahut affect hua too bad use love nahin mila maybe use kiera knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha <end>
<begin> how come you dislike her so much <end>	<begin> kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho <end>
<begin> is it because you guys used to date <end>	<begin> kya isliye ki tum log dating karte the <end>
<begin> mostly just for hogging that driftwood in titanic <end>	<begin> mostly driftwood ke hogging ke liye titanic mein <end>
<begin> oh yeah i have never seen that one <end>	<begin> oh haan maine kabhi nahin dekha tha usko <end>
<begin> i find her wiry trite and egotistical i only enjoy those qualities in myself <end>	<begin> mujhe woh wirytrite aur egotistical laga mujhe sirf who qualities apne mein lagta hai <end>
<begin> i know there is that song by celine dion <end>	<begin> mujhe malum hai woh song celine dion se hai <end>
<begin> haha that is funny i figured that but didnt want to say <end>	<begin> ha bahut hi majedar hai hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete <end>
<begin> she is kind of a walking plattitude kind of like reese witherspoon but more indiana less texas <end>	<begin> woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai reese witherspoon ki tarah lekin jyada indiana aur kum texas <end>
<begin> or something <end>	<begin> ya kuch kuch <end>
<begin> oh its ok im not blind however after looking at keira knightley for <number> hours i might be <end>	<begin> arey teek hai hum andha nahi hai lekin do ghante tak hum keira knightly ko dekhne ke badh ho sakta hai <end>
<begin> still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told ill have to tune in <end>	<begin> phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye humko sunna padega <end>
<begin> anyways she didnt ruin the movie if anything turings life ruins the movie its just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love he could have just worked out made some friends and been happy it is a very important story reminds me of the life of charles darwin or plato <end>	<begin> vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai woh kam kar sakta tha kuch dost bana sakta tha aur khush reha sakta tha yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai charles darwin ya plato ka yad dilata hai <end>
<begin> oh i really like reese not sure what that says about me <end>	<begin> arre mujhe vastavme reez pasand hai lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai <end>
<begin> that is funny but you dont like kiera <end>	<begin> yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko kiera pasand nahi hai <end>
<begin> i thought cumberbach made a great turing but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem <end>	<begin> mujhe laga ki cumberbakh ne ek mahan turing banaya hai agar woh eminem dalte hai to aur hi majedar hota <end>
<begin> fitness is very important im a big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story <end>	<begin> fitness bahut jaruri hai mi darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi <end>
<begin> well darwin had a rough time on the beagle he was the captains special steward which was a demanding job if you know what i mean <end>	<begin> badiya darwin ka bura time tha beagle par wo captain ka special steward tha jo ki ek demanding job thi agar tum jante ho ki mera kya matlab he <end>
<begin> all of the hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it <end>	<begin> hollywood ke sare newspaper uski badi badi karte dikhai dete hain <end>
<begin> his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life he was certainly an interesting fellow <end>	<begin> uski theory darasal ek analogy thi uski captain and station ke life ke liye or uski apni life main evolution to a higher station ke feeling ke liye wo waqai ek interesting admi tha <end>
<begin> i seriously loved this turing movie you have to see it <end>	<begin> seriously mujhe turing movie pasand ayi tumhain dekhni hogi <end>
<begin> i dont usually take anything the hollywood reporter says to heart though <end>	<begin> halanki main dil par nahin leta jobhi hollywood ke reporter ne kaha <end>
<begin> no they have their own problems <end>	<begin> nahin unki apni problems hain <end>
<begin> and what do they know about science <end>	<begin> or wo science ke bare main kya jante hain <end>
<begin> not since they gave the big lebowski such awful reviews <end>	<begin> jabse unhone the big lebowski jese awful reviews tabse nahin <end>
<begin> turing is an important guy id rather see a movie about kurt godel or giordano bruno <end>	<begin> turing ek important admi he main iske bajae kurl godel ya giordano bruno ki movie dekhunga <end>
<begin> or maybe a serious horror drama about galileo <end>	<begin> or shayad galileo ke bare main serious horror drama <end>
<begin> i think the big lebowski was a great film i didnt realize it had a poor critical reception <end>	<begin> mere vichar se big lebowski great film thi mujhe nahi maloom tha ki ise poor critical reception mila <end>
<begin> i actually think i might write a script about the life of galileo <end>	<begin> me actually sochta hu ki mujhe galileo ki life ke bare me ek script likhna chahiye <end>
<begin> your right because scientifically the big lebowski is the best movie ever made yet magazines like empire and variety peed on its rug <end>	<begin> tum right ho kyunki scientifically big lebowski aaj tak banayi gayi best film he iske bawajood empire aur variety jaisi magazines iski apman janak alochna karti he <end>
<begin> people would love that it would make them feel smart <end>	<begin> people pasand karenge ki ye unhe smart feel karayega <end>
<begin> actually that makes sense <end>	<begin> actually ye mayne rakhta he <end>
<begin> i am actually ordained as a dudist priest <end>	<begin> me actually dudist priest ke rup me jana jata hu <end>

<begin> i will for sure check it out on the myface <end>	<begin> main nishchit roop se ise myfachai par dekhoonga <end>
<begin> i think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki myfachai aur spachaibook naamak samaanaantar netavark hona chaahie <end>
<begin> haha i use that term myface all the time <end>	<begin> hah ki main har samay myfachai shabd ka upayog karata hoon <end>
<begin> great minds think alike <end>	<begin> bade man vaale aisa sochate hain <end>
<begin> i once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstars <end>	<begin> mainne ek baar dankin bakestaar naamak ek kophee kee dukaan kholane ke vichaar ke saath khilavaad kiya <end>
<begin> but yes they say iron knows iron <end>	<begin> lekin haan ve kahate hain ki loha lohe ko jaanata hai <end>
<begin> it said there would be three pages yet we seem to be done <end>	<begin> isane kaha ki teen pej honge phir bhee ham aisa karate prateet hote hain <end>

<begin> no worries oh yeah i thought meryl streep and tom hanks were both pretty good <end>	<begin> koi nahi oh muje lagta hai maeryl steep aur tom hanks dono briya hai <end>
<begin> so it apparently has a rotten tomatoes rating of <number> which surprises me because like you said most people dont seem to go for political thrillers <end>	<begin> jaise rotten tomatoes ne ise <number> ki rating di mai surprised hu kayoki jayda log political thrillers nahi dekte <end>
<begin> i think it has a lot to do with the cast to be honest meryl and tom and sarah paulson as well if they didnt get those larger names more people would have ignored it <end>	<begin> muje lagta hai cast ne kafi acha kiya hai jaise meryl tomaur sarah agar unke naam itne bare nahi hote to log unhe ignor kar dete <end>
<begin> im looking to see who sarah paulson played i saw it too <end>	<begin> mai dekhna chahuga sarah paulson kaun play karta hai mai bhi <end>
<begin> oh she was tony <end>	<begin> acha tho tony hein voh <end>
<begin> its described as an american historical thriller which i guess i agree with given the nature of the pentagon papers <end>	<begin> american historical thriller se described kiya hein jo muje guess ki voh nature ka pentagon papers diya hoga <end>
<begin> i didnt realize it was directed by steven spielberg <end>	<begin> muje realize hi nahi hota ki steven spielberg ne direct kiya hain <end>

<begin> yeah it was interesting to see how the court case played out and how the newspapers sort of stood together <end>	<begin> haan kaafi interesting hein jaise kaise courtcase ne played out kiya aur kaise newspaper ne us stood ko aapas mein sort out kiya <end>
<begin> matthew rhys was in it tooi like him as an actor <end>	<begin> matthew rhys bhi they muje unhe pasand hein <end>
<begin> critics seemed to be torn about the movie <end>	<begin> is movie mein tho torn hi behetar critics se saath <end>
<begin> one said the post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama <end>	<begin> yek kaha ki is post tho trickiest test passe huva hei is historical drama mein <end>
<begin> another said is too calculated to reflect todays ragged tenuous sociopolitical climate <end>	<begin> dusra kaha kiaajkal ka ragged tho thoda reflect hein calculate karne pe tenuous sociopolitical climate <end>
<begin> do you think you would see it again <end>	<begin> kya aap dubara dekhne ko pasand karenge <end>
<begin> i i think seeing it a second time would be helpful to pick up the little things i might have missed im not sure i would categorize it as calculated it was intense but i thought in a good way <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki yah doosaree baar dekhane se madad milegee jo mainne yaad kiya ho sakata hai chhotee cheejon ko lene ke lie mujhe yakeen nahin hai ki main ise ganana ke roop mein vargeekrt karoonga yah teevr tha lekin mainne achchhe tareeke se socha show less <end>
<begin> who was your favorite actor in the movie <end>	<begin> tumhara manpasand hero kon hai movie main <end>
<begin> meryl streep for sure being the first female publisher of a major news source it was really amazing to see her part in the struggle and how it was unique to that role <end>	<begin> meril streep ke lie sunishchit karen ek pramukh samaachaar srot kee pahalee mahila prakaashak hone ke naate sangharsh mein apane hisse ko dekhana vaastav mein aashcharyajanak tha aur us bhoomika ke lie yah kaise adviteey tha <end>
<begin> yeah there were some moments in the movie for sure <end>	<begin> hnji movie main kuch moment jaroor honge <end>
<begin> i didnt realize the employee who leaked the papers had worked at the rand corporation <end>	<begin> mujhe is baat ka ehasaas nahin tha ki kaagajaat leek karane vaale karmachaaree ne rand korporeshan mein kaam kiya tha <end>
<begin> what did you think of tom hanks performance in the movie <end>	<begin> tumhe tom hanks ka movie main kaam kaisa lga <end>

<begin> no i think he was just disenchanted with the war and how we had escalated our involvement <end>	<begin> nahin mujhe lagata hai ki vah yuddh se vimukh tha aur hamane apanee bhaageedaaree ko kaise badhaaya tha <end>
<begin> apparently ellsberg overheard robert mcnamara saying he thought the war was hopeless even though he was telling the public it was going well and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth <end>	<begin> ellsberg tho robert mcnamara se bol raha tha ki yeh war hopeless hein even though voh voh public ke saath bole ki yeh ache jaayega aur voh disillusioned ban gaye aur truth leak karne ke decide kiya <end>

<begin> do you think graham made the right choice to publish <end>	<begin> kya aap sochte graham publish karne ka right choice hein <end>
<begin> im a little torn but given the seriousness of the issue yes normally i would tend to side with the government but this was really mismanaged it was an important decision for the court to side with the paper <end>	<begin> mein tho thoda torn lekin yeh seriousness issue hein haan normally mein tho government ka side hon lekin voh mismanaged hein yeh tho unka important decision hein court ka us paper ko side rakhna <end>
<begin> i just got another update <end>	<begin> haan muje dusra update mila <end>
<begin> here is a question for you would you recommend this movie to people you know who havent seen it <end>	<begin> aap ke liye yek question kya aap is movie ko recommend karenge <end>
<begin> i would recommend it for sure to most people despite it taking place int he <number> s i feel spielberg took it in a really exciting direction instead of just throwing facts at you about the case <end>	<begin> mai isse jayada logo ko recommand karta hubavjud he place <number> muje lagta hai spoelberg exciting hai <end>
<begin> i think it was filmed well and i was surprised how much suspense built even though i already knew the basic facts <end>	<begin> yah ek achi film thi mai surprised hu itne jayada suspense the jabki mai sare fact janta ta <end>
<begin> there were so many details i had no idea about and i like how it sort of set the stage for the watergate scandal right afterwards with nixon <end>	<begin> isme itne sare detail the muje idea nahi thaaur muje pasant aya watergate scandal nixon ke saath <end>
<begin> i completely forgot about that scene at the end just got some details for the movie summary and it mentions that i guess that was one year later <end>	<begin> mai ant ka seen bilkul bhul gayamoive ki summary milne par laga yah yek saal bad <end>
<begin> what did you think of the part when the case went to the supreme court <end>	<begin> jab case superme court me tha us part ke bare me kya socha <end>
<begin> honestly i really liked all of the scenes with jesse plemons as the lawyer i thought he nailed it as far as lawyers taking a straight line even when something outside the box comes up i wondered if the lines he spoke were based on facts and actual testimony <end>	<begin> muje jesse plemons ke lawyer vale sabhi seen pasand muje lagta hai usne as sabi ceejo ko achi trah nibaya muje achtray hua usaki boli sabi line actual fact par thi <end>
<begin> it looks like were all done here thanks for chatting <end>	<begin> ise laga jaise hum hi bat kar rahe ho <end>
<begin> i dont remember much about the lawyer i just liked how the other newspapers picke dup the mantle to support the post and times <end>	<begin> mai lawyer ke bare jayda nahi sochamaine keval yah socha dusre paper kasi support kare <end>
<begin> oh yeah thanks <end>	<begin> oh ha thanks <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> namaste <end>
<begin> hey whats up <end>	<begin> hey kya ho raha hai <end>
<begin> have you watched la la land before <end>	<begin> tumne pehle la la land dekhi hai <end>
<begin> yes i really appreciated how much thought went into the movies title i think its really cool how it refers to los angeles music and having your head in the clouds all at once its really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title <end>	<begin> han mein sach mein iss baat ki kadra karta hu ki iss film k title mein kitni soch lagayi hai mein sochta hu ki ye bohat cool hai ki ye film los angeles snageet aur apne sir badalon mein hone ka jikra ek sath karti hai yah bohat shandar hai ki unhone itne sare tatvon ko ek sath shamil kar lia film k itne chhote title mein <end>
<begin> have you seen it <end>	<begin> kya tumne dekha hai <end>
<begin> yep i watched it because critics seemed to like it <end>	<begin> han meine usse dekha hai kyuki wah aalochakon ko achhi lagi <end>
<begin> i agree with most of the critics in the paper <end>	<begin> mein zyadatar aalochakon k sath sehmat hu <end>
<begin> yes i especially agree with the review that la la land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream <end>	<begin> han mein uss review se khaaskar sehmat hu jismein kaha hai ki la la land sapno k peeche bhaagne par aaney wali pareshaniyon ko dikhane mein safal huyi <end>
<begin> i disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring i really found the entire movie to be enthralling <end>	<begin> mein disgree hu dono reviews se ki film dull hai or middle boring tha mujhe really puri movie enthralling lagi <end>
<begin> yep i agree with you i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack since theyre not singers <end>	<begin> yep mein aapse agree hu mujhe believe hai humko emma stone and ryan gosling kuch slack hai kyuki woh singers nahi hai <end>
<begin> agreed i really liked the scene where sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing christmas music only <end>	<begin> mujhe really woh scene pasand aaya jaha sebastian jazz music play kiya jaha usne sirf christmas music play kar raha hai <end>
<begin> it was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after i watched the movie <end>	<begin> yeh un scenes mein se ek hai jo movie dekhne ke baad mere se stuck ho gaye <end>
<begin> would you do that if you were in his position <end>	<begin> aap yesa karte if aap uski position mein hote <end>
<begin> im not sure i liked how that was when mia first heard sebastian sing and was truly moved by it i think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship <end>	<begin> im not sure mujhe accha laga jab mia ne pheli baar sebastian ka gana suna aur kaise woh truly moved ho gayi i think yeh unka relationship start karne ka interesting way hai <end>
<begin> yeah it was just sad how he brushed her off since things couldve been different <end>	<begin> yeah yeh sad hai usne kaise brush kiya kyuki things different ho sakti thi <end>
<begin> i do like how the next time mia sees sebastian he is also singing i also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing <end>	<begin> mujhe accha laga next time mia sebastian ko dekthi hai waih bhi gaa raha hai mujhe yeh bhi accha laga ki woh kaise unko ek song ka request karke tease kar rahi hai jabki woh janti hai woh gaane se hate karta hai <end>
<begin> do you usually watch musicals <end>	<begin> tum usually musicals dekhte ho <end>
<begin> occasionally i also enjoyed the development of sebastian and mias relationship such as when mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her i feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship <end>	<begin> occasionally mujhe sbesatian aur mia ke relationship ka development accha laga jaise mia se decide kiya apne aap se play write karne ka kyuki sebastian ne usko suggest kiya mujhe yesa feel hua dono jab grow hue jab wo relationship mein aaye <end>
<begin> i enjoyed that part too since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams <end>	<begin> maine bhi wo part enjoy kiya isme ye bhi dikhaya gaya hai kaise dono mehnat karte hai apne dreams achieve karne <end>
<begin> they both want to become successful in their separate areas but they have to struggle a lot <end>	<begin> dono apne separate areas mein kamiyaab hona chahte hailekin unhe bahut struggle karna hai <end>
<begin> right i feel like the review that mentions the cruelty thats involved in following your dreams really sums it up the film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big <end>	<begin> sahi mujhe lagta hai review jisme zulm ka zikar hai tumhaare khawaab puray karne wo bahut acha sum up kiya hai film darti nahi hai ye dikhaane ke kitne mehnat aur hardship lagti hai kuch bada karne <end>
<begin> i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keiths offer <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi laga sebastian ko keith ka offer lene mushkil hui <end>
<begin> i mean he gets paid but its not something he wants to do this happens in life a lot <end>	<begin> mera matlab hai usko pay mila lekin wo ye nahi karna chahta life mein aisa bahut hota hai <end>
<begin> i agree it must be hard to do something youre not passionate about especially when its something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams <end>	<begin> main maanta hoon aap jiske baare main passionate nahi haiwo karna mushkil hai especially jub wo kuch aisa hai jo aap ko karna hota hai ek din apne dreams puray karne <end>
<begin> what did you think of the scene when mia and sebastian get into a fight about mia thinking sebastian is giving up on his dreams <end>	<begin> us scene ke baare mein aap ka kya khayal hai jub mia aur sebastian ka jhagda hota hai aur mia samajhti hai sebastian is giving up on his dreams <end>
<begin> it was definitely well acted and i sympathize with both of them <end>	<begin> ye yaqeenan well acted tha aur mujhe dono se sympathy hai <end>
<begin> but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful <end>	<begin> lekin shayad sebastian harsh tha jub usne kaha ke mia uskozyada pasand karti thi jub wo unsuccessful tha <end>
<begin> it truly was heartbreaking when mia moved back home to nevada <end>	<begin> sach mein bahut heartbreaking tha jub mia wapis apne ghar nevada chale jaati hai <end>
<begin> i feel he didnt want to hear the truth because he was really giving up on his dreams <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai wo sach nahi sunna chahta kyunki wo apne sapno ko chod raha hai <end>
<begin> it really was sad <end>	<begin> wo sach mein sad tha <end>
<begin> i agree it was also a very unpredictable plot twist i did not see it coming at all <end>	<begin> main bhi maanta hun ki unpredictable twist tha kahani mein jiska bilkul andaza nahi tha <end>
<begin> would you say that was the low point in the movie <end>	<begin> kya tum maante ho ki wo kahani ka low point tha <end>
<begin> yes but i wouldnt say any part of the movie sagged badly as one review claims <end>	<begin> haan but mujhe nahi lagta ki movie ka koi bhi part sagged badly tha jaisa ki ek review ne claim kiya tha <end>
<begin> i agree overall i would recommend the movie to a friend <end>	<begin> main bhi maanta hun and main apne friend ko movie zaroor recommend karunga <end>
<begin> i agree as another review points out it was a genuinely romantic comedy which i completely agree with because i feel as though sebastian and mias relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies i appreciated the realness of their relationship <end>	<begin> main maanta hun ki movie genuinely romantic comedy thi jaise ki ek aur reviewer ne point out kiya kyunki mujhe lagta hai jaise sebastian aur mia ka relationship itna cliche nahi tha jitna dusri love stories mein hota hai mujhe unki relationship ki sachai achi lagi <end>
<begin> yes that was one thing i loved about the movie while it was sad it was not a cliche ending <end>	<begin> haan movie ki wo ek cheez achi thi chahe wo sad thi par wo ek cliche ending nahi thi <end>
<begin> i agree i think damien chazelle really did a good job directing the film <end>	<begin> main bhi agree karta hun ki damien chazelle ne film directing ka bahut acha kaam kiya hai <end>
<begin> im curious are you an ai <end>	<begin> mujhe utsukta ho rahi kya aap ai hain <end>
<begin> if so i was completely fooled <end>	<begin> agar aisa hai to i was fooled <end>
<begin> i am not <end>	<begin> main nahi hoon <end>
<begin> but i really was surprised that someone reviewed sebastian as a jazz snob because i did not get that vibe at all <end>	<begin> lekin main bohat surprised tha ki kisine sebastaian ko jazz snob review kia kyunki mujhe aisi vibe nahi aati <end>
<begin> yeah i disagreed with that characterization but i can see why someone might say that <end>	<begin> han mujhe bhi disagree hua is characterization se lekin main samajh sakta hun kisine aisa kyun kaha hoga <end>
<begin> he is a purist or whatever they called it in the film <end>	<begin> wo ek purist hai ya fir jo be usey movie mein bulaya gaya <end>
<begin> i also really didnt think mias character lacked depth i think she was a rather round character especially with the large amount of independence she possessed it took a lot of courage for her to move back to nevada <end>	<begin> mujhe ye bhi nahi lagta ki mia ke character mein depth ki kami thi mujhe lagta hau uska characted kafi round tha khaaskar jis large amount mein uske paas independence thi use nevada waapis move karne mein kafi courage laga <end>
<begin> yes i thought her character was pretty nuanced but im not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada after the play didnt go well i think that was her only option <end>	<begin> han mujhe laga uska character kafi nuanced tha lekin main sure nahi hun ki kya nevada wpas jaana courageous tha play kharab jaane ke baad mujhe lagta hai uske paas sirf yahi option tha <end>
<begin> about it <end>	<begin> uske baare me <end>
<begin> i suppose you have a point i just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didnt cling on to sebastian when things didnt work out for her <end>	<begin> aapke pas point hai mujhe lagta hai wo films mein portray ki jaane wali average woman se zyada independent thu kyunki jab uska kaam sahi nahi bana to usne sebastian ko cling nahi kia <end>
<begin> although i wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams <end>	<begin> lekin main chahta tha ki wo apne dreams achieve karne se pehle reconcile ho jaate <end>
<begin> the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad <end>	<begin> end me jo dikhaya tha wah mujhe actually kafi sad kar sakta tha <end>
<begin> i agree it was very sad but also as one reviewer puts it quite bittersweet i wasnt sure how to feel at the end <end>	<begin> i agree ki wah bhi bahut sad tha jaise ek reviewer ne kaha hai yah kafi bittersweet hai mai sure nahi tha ki end mai kaisa feel karu <end>
<begin> it was nice discussing the film with you have a great day <end>	<begin> tumhare sath film discuss karna nice tha have a great day <end>
<begin> you guys have a pretty good ai system <end>	<begin> tum logo ke pass kafi badhiya ai system hai <end>
<begin> i was actually completely fooled <end>	<begin> mai actually complete fool ban gaya tha <end>
<begin> hi there <end>	<begin> hi <end>
<begin> i havent seen bruce almighty for some reason but i do love jim carrey <end>	<begin> mein bruce almighty ko nahi dekha kuch reason ke liye lekin muej jim carrey pasand hein <end>
<begin> i havent seen this one either but i have heard that it is pretty funny <end>	<begin> mein bhi nahi dekha lekin mein sunna hoon ki voh jyada funny hein <end>
<begin> its a pretty great idea im sure its not one of the greatest movies ever made but he is really funny and so is morgan freeman <end>	<begin> yeh tho badiya idea hein muje nahi lagtha ki yeh unka greatest movies mein yek hein kyon ki voh itna funny hein jaise morgan freeman ke tarah <end>
<begin> jennifer aniston annoys me a little though i gotta say <end>	<begin> jeenifer aniston tho muje bahut annoys karti aur mein bolne hi vaali thi <end>
<begin> i really do like morgan freeman most of his movies are good i think i might have to check this one out <end>	<begin> main sahi mein morgan freeman ko pasand krta huin uski bahut si movies achhi hain mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe isse bhi dekhna chahiye <end>
<begin> i look at rotten tomatoes a lot for movie ratings though and <number> is pretty low it has been out for a while though <end>	<begin> haanlanki main rotton tomatoes ko dekhta huin movie ratings check krne ke liye aur <number> bahut kam hai haanlanki ye bahut dair se bahar hai <end>
<begin> i dont know why but she has annoyed me through the years too i cant quite put my finger on what it is i just dont really like her very much <end>	<begin> mujhe nhi pta kyu but usne mujhe saalon se pareshaan kiya hai main apni finger iss par nhi daal sakta ki yeh kya hai sach mein main use bahut pasand nhi karta <end>
<begin> yes it has been out for quite some time maybe its on netflix <end>	<begin> han kafi samay se bahar hai shayad ye netflix pe bhi hai <end>
<begin> do you like comedies like this or are you more into dramas <end>	<begin> kya tumhe aisi comedies pasand hai ya tum tumhe dramas zyada pasand hai <end>
<begin> my favorite movie genre is science fiction but i do like a good comedy or a good drama if its a good movie i really dont care what genre it is <end>	<begin> meri favorite movie genre hai science fiction but mujhe acchi comedy bhi acchi lagti hai ya achha drama agar ye ek acchi movie hai to main asal mein parwaah nhi krti ki ye kis genre ki hai <end>
<begin> thats true the first review under the critical response section is pretty harsh im not sure i really ever read or care about movie reviews just the ratings online <end>	<begin> yeh sahi hai critical response section ka pehla review bahut harsh hai main sure nhi huin main movie reviews padhne ya itni parwaah nhi krta sirf online ratings <end>
<begin> when looking at movie reviews i put more faith in actual regular people that go see the movie then i do official critics <end>	<begin> jab movie reviews dekhte main faith official critics se zyada asal regular logo pe dekhta huin jo movie dekh kar aaye hain <end>
<begin> true looking at the key scenes i feel like the plot might have been a little paint by numbers and relying on jim carreys personality too much which is probably why it wasnt better recieved <end>	<begin> sahi key scenes ko dekhte hai to mujhe lagta hai ki plot thoda paint by numbers aur jim carrey ki personality pe bahut zyada nirbhar hai shayad issi wajah hai ki better nhi mila <end>
<begin> yes i can i didnt get that impression <end>	<begin> han main kar skta huin mujhe achha impression nhi mila <end>
<begin> sorry this is supposed to say that i did get that impression <end>	<begin> sorry ye kahana chahiye ki mujhe vah aabhas mila <end>
<begin> i guess thats part of his appeal he can take any kind of material and make it funny also steve carrell is a great funny actor too and i can see him being a good villian <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki ye unki appeal ka hissa hai vah kisi bhi tarah ka material leke aur use funny bana sakate he sath hi steve carrell ek mahaan funny actor bhi hain aur main unhe ek achchha villian bhi dekh sakta hu <end>
<begin> yes he is pretty good in everything he does <end>	<begin> ha vah apane har kaam mein bahut achchhe hai <end>
<begin> i havent even heard of metacritic or cinemascore to be honest but its weird that its <number> on metacritic and and a on cinemascore those are pretty different scores <end>	<begin> maine bhi metacritic ya cinemascore pramanik hone ke bare mein nahin suna hai lekin yah ajib hai ki yah metacritic par <number> hai aur cinemascore pe a hai yah bahut alag scores hain <end>
<begin> thats true im not sure how they score these things <end>	<begin> yah sach hai mujhe yakin nahin hai ki ve in chijo ko kaise score karte hai <end>
<begin> the part where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto reply yes is pretty funny and says a lot about religion <end>	<begin> vah hissa jaha vah prarthanao ka javab dene ke liye email system banata hai aur ise auto reply haa ke liye set karata hai vah bahut hi majedar hai aur dhharm ke bare me bahut kuchh kahata hai <end>
<begin> sounds pretty funny i will have to put it on my list <end>	<begin> bahut majedar lagata hai mujhe ise apane list mein rakhana hoga <end>
<begin> i do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with jimmy hoffas body sound cheesy im not sure <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki sayad jimmy hoffa ki body sound ke saath kuchh drashyon ka varnan hai main sure nahin hu <end>
<begin> i agree with that statement <end>	<begin> main usse sahamat hu <end>
<begin> i do think if i had the power of being god id use it for better things <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki agar mere paas god hone ki shakti hoti to main isaka istemal behtar chijon ke liye karata <end>
<begin> for sure <end>	<begin> for sure <end>
<begin> interesting i mean the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard <end>	<begin> interesting i mean baaki jaise plot wrap up hote hai kaafi standard lagta hai <end>
<begin> i agree however it might be worth a watch <end>	<begin> i agree but ek time watch worth ho sakti hai <end>
<begin> the best part of the movie is probably the middle section where hes testing out all of his powers seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description <end>	<begin> movie ka best part probably middle section hai jaha wo apni sari power test karta hai aisa lagta hai k end description k basis pe disappointing ho sakta hai <end>
<begin> im not the hugest jim carrey fan but ill give it a try <end>	<begin> main jim carrey ka bada fan to nahi hu but main ek try karunga <end>
<begin> yeah i think he is so out there that this is a perfect film for him <end>	<begin> haan mujhe lagta hai k wo aise bahar hai k ye film uske liye perfect hai <end>
<begin> yeah he always seems to play some crazy out of control guy <end>	<begin> haan wo hamesha koi crazy out of control aadmi play karta hai <end>

<begin> hi its the imitation game <end>	<begin> hi wo the imitation game hai <end>
<begin> does it seem interesting <end>	<begin> kay wo interesting lag rahi hai <end>
<begin> definitely it takes place during wwii and its decrypting spy code messages <end>	<begin> jaroor ye sab during wwii huva tha or its decrypting spy code messages <end>
<begin> cool is there a main lead actor or actress thats easily identifiable <end>	<begin> cool kay us me main leaf actor or actress easily identifiable hai <end>
<begin> yes it stars benedict cumberbatch and keira knightly its got a pretty good score on rotten tomatoes and cinemascore <end>	<begin> ha iss me benedict cumberbatch and keira knightly hai is co accha score mila hai tomatoes and cinemascore pe <end>
<begin> good to know what studio is it produced by <end>	<begin> good to know kis studio ne isse produce kiya hai <end>
<begin> im not sure about that but did you know there was an earlier movie about the same book <end>	<begin> muze nahi pata uske bareme per tum ko pata hai kay there was an earlier movie about the same book <end>
<begin> so its based on a book <end>	<begin> to ye kitap be based hai <end>
<begin> yes its based on alan turing the enigma and the earlier movie was called breaking the code it was on bbc <end>	<begin> yes ye based hai alan turing the enigma or pehele ki movie ka nam tha breaking the code wo bbc pe thi <end>
<begin> good to know although i didnt ask does it say who starred in the bbc version <end>	<begin> jaanakaar achchha laga haalaanki mainne poochha nahin kya yah kahana hai ki bbc sanskaran mein kisane abhinay kiya <end>
<begin> no but ive got info on a few of the key scenes if youre interested in knowing <end>	<begin> nahin lekin mujhe kuchh pramukh drshyon kee jaanakaaree milee hai yadi aap jaanane mein ruchi rakhate hain <end>
<begin> absolutely are the scenes taken from the book the bbc version or the movie <end>	<begin> poorn roop se pustak se lie gae drshy hain bbc sanskaran ya philm <end>
<begin> from the <number> movie with cumberbatch and knightley the earliest scene has turing in boarding school being bullied and he makes a friend there that gets him interested in cryptography <end>	<begin> <number> kee philm se kambarabaich aur naitalee ke saath shuruaatee drshy mein tyooring in bording skool ko badanaam kiya ja raha hai aur vah vahaan ek dost banaata hai jo use kriptograaphee mein dilachaspee leta hai <end>
<begin> thats cool so its sort of a biographical movie <end>	<begin> yah achchha hai to yah ek jeevanee philm kee tarah hai <end>
<begin> the next scene is when britain declares war on germany turing goes to work at a place called bletchley park that is trying to decode the nazis enigma machine yes its a historical drama <end>	<begin> agala drshy hai jab briten ne jarmanee par yuddh kee ghoshana kee tyooring ek jagah par kaam karane jaata hai jise bailechale paark kaha jaata hai vah naajee kee pahelee masheen ko dikod karane kee koshish kar raha hai haan yah ek aitihaasik naatak hai <end>
<begin> do you want to hear the plot <end>	<begin> kya aap kathaanak sunana chaahate hain <end>
<begin> does it mention how accurate the movie is as opposed to real life events thats why i was asking if it was biographical as opposed to simply historical <end>	<begin> kya yah ullekh karata hai philm vaastavik jeevan kee ghatanaon ke vipareet kitanee sahee hai isalie main poochh raha tha yadi yah keval aitihaasik ke vipareet jeevanee thee <end>
<begin> oh one of the critics says it rearranges the time sequences and invents fictional characters <end>	<begin> oh ek aalochak kahata hai yah samay drshyon ko punarvyavasthit karata hai aur kaalpanik paatron ko laagoo karata hai <end>
<begin> thanks for the clarification are there any more excerpts <end>	<begin> spashteekaran ke lie dhanyavaad kya koee aur ansh hain <end>
<begin> yes the plot sounds really good turing manages to decrypt the nazi code machine but the nazis change the code every day so they all realize they cant act on every days decrypted messages or the nazis will know that their code machine is useless <end>	<begin> haan kathaanak vaastav mein achchha lagata hai tyooring naajee kod masheen ko dikript karane ka prabandhan karata hai lekin naajiyon ne har din kod badal diya isalie ve sabhee mahasoos karate hain ki ve har din dikript kie gae sandeshon par kaam nahin kar sakate hain ya naajiyon ko pata chal jaega ki unakee kod masheen bekaar hai <end>
<begin> interesting does it mention how its resolved or does it leave you sort of on the cliff <end>	<begin> dilachasp hai yah ullekh karata hai ki yah kaise hal ho gaya hai ya kya yah aapako chattaan par chhodata hai <end>
<begin> it kind of leaves a cliffhanger there there are a couple of twists though <end>	<begin> yah vahaan ek kliphanar ko chhod deta hai haalaanki kuchh jode hain <end>
<begin> does it say whether the main characters survive to the end or are they wounded etcetera <end>	<begin> kya yah kahata hai ki kya mukhy paatr ant tak jeevit rahate hain ya ve ghaayal hote hain vagairah <end>
<begin> it doesnt tell one of the twists in the plot is that a russian spy is discovered by turing which isnt surprising at first but then we find out that british intelligence planted him to tell the russians secrets they wanted them to know after all russia and great britain were on the same side in wwii <end>	<begin> yah nahin bataata saajish mein ek tvist yah hai ki tyooring dvaara ek roosee jaasoos kee khoj kee jaatee hai yah pahalee baar mein aashcharyachakit karane vaala nahin hai lekin phir hamen pata chala ki british khuphiya ne unhen roos ke rahasyon ko bataane ke lie lagaaya tha jo ve jaanana chaahate the aakhirakaar roos aur gret briten wwii mein ek hee taraph the <end>
<begin> thats sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation but whatever anything else super useful or interesting it sounds like a great movie <end>	<begin> yah raajaneetik sthiti ke ek mod kee tarah hai lekin jo kuchh bhee supar upayogee ya dilachasp hai yah ek mahaan philm kee tarah lagata hai <end>
<begin> when i watched the movie i liked the codebreaking machine they had it was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of wwii yes theres another twist in the plot where the russian spy threatens to tell everyone that turing is homosexual <end>	<begin> jab mainne philm dekhee to mujhe unake paas kodabreking masheen pasand aaee yah is vishaal takaneekee dikhane vaalee deevaar thee jo wwii ke samay se pahale thee haan saajish mein ek aur mod hai jahaan roosee jaasoos ne sabhee ko yah bataane kee dhamakee dee ki tyooring samalaingik hai <end>
<begin> how did the spy know that turing was gay <end>	<begin> jaasoos ko kaise pata chala ki tyooring samalaingik tha <end>
<begin> turing told the spy because turing was about to get married to clarke knightley it sounds like high drama to me the spy before turing realized he was a spy told turing to keep his homosexuality a secret i guess they were pretty tight <end>	<begin> tyooring ne jaasoos ko bataaya kyonki tyooring kee shaadee klaark naitalee se hone vaalee thee yah mujhe uchch naatak kee tarah lagata hai jaasoos tyooring se pahale ehasaas hua ki vah ek jaasoos tha ne tyooring ko apanee samalaingikata ko gupt rakhane ke lie kaha tha mujhe lagata hai ki ve bahut tang the <end>
<begin> wow thats a big ol ball of secrecy for that time period is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell me <end>	<begin> vaah yah us samay kee avadhi ke lie ek badee raajabhaasha gopaneeyata kee gend hai kya saajish ke baare mein kuchh aur hai ya jo kuchh bhee aapako mujhe bataana chaahie <end>
<begin> yes at the end of the movie the allies win the war and the boss makes the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code also turing tells clarke knightley to leave because he is scared for her safety he tells her he is gay and that he never cared for her which wasnt true because he was in love with her <end>	<begin> haan philm ke ant mein mitr raashtr yuddh jeetata hai aur bos kriptograaphars ko ek doosare ko phir kabhee nahin dekhane ka vaada karata hai aur ve sabhee kod ko nasht kar dete hain isake alaava tyooring klaark naitalee ko chhodane ke lie kahata hai kyonki vah usakee suraksha ke lie darata hai vah usase kahata hai ki vah samalaingik hai aur usane kabhee usakee paravaah nahin kee jo sach nahin tha kyonki vah usake saath pyaar mein thee <end>
<begin> it got a pretty good score on rotten tomatoes <end>	<begin> roten tomaatoz par ise bahut achchha skor mila <end>
<begin> whats the rotten tomatoes score <end>	<begin> sada hua tamaatar skor kya hai <end>
<begin> rotten tomatoes is <number> cinemascore is a and metacritic score is a bit low at <number> <end>	<begin> roten tomaatoz <number> hai sinemaaskor e hai aur metaakritik skor <number> par thoda kam hai <end>
<begin> hmm not bad at all does it say when it was released <end>	<begin> hamm bilkul bhee bura nahin hai yah kahata hai ki yah kab jaaree kiya gaya tha <end>
<begin> i think that about does it for this movie do you think youll see it <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki is philm ke baare mein kya aapako lagata hai ki aap ise dekhenge <end>
<begin> in <number> <end>	<begin> <number> mein <end>
<begin> it sounds really good more likely than not i will how about you <end>	<begin> yah vaastav mein achchha lagata hai adhik sambhaavana nahin hai main karoonga aap kaise hain <end>
<begin> i didnt realize i had already seen it until i started reading this i remember it was really good if a movie isnt good i usually dont recall it this clearly <end>	<begin> i didnt realize i had already seen it until i started reading this i remember it was really good if a movie isnt good i usually dont recall it this clearly <end>
<begin> it was definitely a good look into what life was like during that horrible war its been good chatting with you i enjoyed <end>	<begin> us bhayaanak yuddh ke dauraan jeevan kaisa tha yah nishchit roop se achchha tha yah aapake saath achchhee chaiting hai mujhe maza aaya <end>
<begin> lol likewise im pretty sure we just do the exit survey at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie right <end>	<begin> yogy isee tarah mujhe poora yakeen hai ki ham sirph is bindu par baahar nikalane ka sarvekshan karenge aur unhen bataenge ki kya ham philm dekhana chaahate hain hai na <end>
<begin> hi are you ready to get started this is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie are you familiar with those superheroes <end>	<begin> hi kya tum shuru krne ke liye tyaar ho yeh batman vs superman ek superhero crossover movie hai kya tum inn superheroes ko jante ho <end>
<begin> we are here to discuss batman vs superman dawn of justice <end>	<begin> hum yahan batman vs superman dawn of justice ko discuss karenge <end>
<begin> yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of <end>	<begin> han mujhe inn cahracters ke baare mein pta hai but kuch actors ke baare mein maine kabhi sunna nhi <end>
<begin> i think it sounds like an amazing movie i love superheroes i think some of the critics are too harsh it was a good plot line i am familiar with ben affleck but none of the others <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai ki yeh ek bahut achhi movie hai mujhe superheroes bahut pasand hai yeh achhi plot line thi main ban affleck ke baare mein jaanta huin but bake kisi ke baare mein nhi <end>
<begin> i wish they would have used more famous people <end>	<begin> kaash unhone zyada famous logo ko liya hota <end>
<begin> i would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel the plot line of that was amazing <end>	<begin> main sehmat huin jabki woh man of steel jitni achhi nhi hai uski plot line bahut badiya thi <end>
<begin> ben affleck is the only actor i recognize great plot very harsh critcs <end>	<begin> ben affleck hi sirf ek aisa actor hai jise main pehnchanta huin achha plot bhut harsh critics <end>
<begin> i agree i didnt completely understand why batman and superman fought though <end>	<begin> i agree mujhe theek se samajh nahi aaya ki batman and superman kyun lad rahe the <end>
<begin> rotten tomatoes list it as <number> and average with a <number> out of <number> the critcs must be weird yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad <end>	<begin> rotten tomatoes par <number> hai and average <number> hai <number> mein se critics bahut ajeeb hain mujhe fight samajh nahi aayi par mujhe lagta hai ki superman ne galti se bruce wayne ke dad ko maar diya tha <end>
<begin> i thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than <number> that seemed low that makes sense i would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members <end>	<begin> mujhe laga ki movie ka meteoritic score <number> se jyada hai yeh toh kam hai par sense karta hai mujhe bhi bahut gussa ayega agar kisi ne mere family waalon ko maar diya <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> haan <end>
<begin> yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of lex luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie i like how the critic talked about lex who is supermans arch enemy because he compared him to the joker and riddler who are batmans arch enemies <end>	<begin> haan mujhe bhi saath mein lex ke character ka unique spin hai aur voh bus spiral down karta hai poori movie mein joh critics ne lex joh superman ka arch enemy hai ke baare mein bola voh mujhe accha laga kyunki unhone lex ko joker and riddler ke saath compare kiya <end>
<begin> then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to mark zuckerburg <end>	<begin> aur fir voh pagalon jaise usko mark zuckerburg se compare karne laga <end>
<begin> ohh i liked that too i like how they always try to biring in the government official s <end>	<begin> ohh voh mujhe bhi accha laga mujhe accha laga ki they always bring in government officials <end>
<begin> yeah im still here just slow typer <end>	<begin> yeah meri typing slow hai im still here <end>
<begin> do you like batman or superman better in the movie <end>	<begin> tujhe jyada accha kaun laga batman or superman iss movie mein <end>
<begin> actually superman <end>	<begin> actually superman <end>
<begin> how bout u <end>	<begin> tumhare regarding kya vichar he <end>
<begin> i grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate s and early s in which alll the superheros worked together <end>	<begin> <number> aur early s me me cartoon justice league dekhte hue grew up hua jisame all super hero milkar work karte he <end>
<begin> i love batman <end>	<begin> mujhe batman se love he <end>
<begin> he is so mysterious <end>	<begin> vo bahut mysterious he <end>
<begin> sorta ironic that they become enemies <end>	<begin> ye bada ironic he ki ve enemies ban jate he <end>
<begin> yes he is very mysterious <end>	<begin> ha vo bada mysterious he <end>
<begin> it is its not what i expected at all <end>	<begin> it isye to mene bilkul bhi expect nahi kiya tha <end>
<begin> i expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together <end>	<begin> iske bajay me to avenger ki try expect kar raha tha where heroes ka bunch together work karta he <end>
<begin> i dont really like that they are enimies <end>	<begin> mujhe unka ememies hona really pasand nahi aaya <end>
<begin> especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman <end>	<begin> especially us point par jahan batman superman ko kill karne ja raha tha <end>
<begin> me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi par pretty much superman ne ye start kiya article kehta hai clark kent apne news articles se bruce wayne aur batman ko bad dikhane ki try kar raha tha <end>
<begin> you know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies <end>	<begin> kya tum jante ho to be honest agar tum dekho world ajkal kis way ka hai full of bad to world view mein unhe enemies ki tarah hona perfect sense banata hai <end>
<begin> i guess so they do have polar opposite personalities one is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive <end>	<begin> main aisa hi guess karta hun un dono ki polar opposite personalities hain ek humble farmboy hau aur dusra rich executive hai <end>
<begin> i could see why they clash in that aspect but i guess i dont imagine them interacting very much in superhero world <end>	<begin> main samajh sakta hun us aspect mein unhone kyun clash kiya par i guess main unhe superhero world mein zaya interact karte nahi dekhta <end>
<begin> it says in the rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman <end>	<begin> ye rd part mein kehte hai ki superman ke funera mein bruce wayne apologise karta hai lois lane ko ki he failed superman <end>
<begin> duuhhhh well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol <end>	<begin> duuhhhh well haan agar usne usey maar diya to he failed him <end>
<begin> i would feel like if i failed someone if i let them die too haha i like the mysterious dirt levitating though <end>	<begin> mujhe bhi lagega ki i failed someone agar main unhe marne de dun haha mujhe mysterious dirt levitating kafi acha laga <end>
<begin> haha <end>	<begin> haha <end>
<begin> thats what i was thinking <end>	<begin> main bhi yahi soch raha tha <end>

<begin> i wonder if there will be a sequel <end>	<begin> agar voh sequel hota <end>
<begin> yes watched it <number> times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies <end>	<begin> haan mein tho <number> baar dekh chuka hoon voh tearjerker tha mere liye jab superman ka moth huva <end>
<begin> i feel like good superhero movies need sequels <end>	<begin> muje tho superhero movies mein sequels pasand hein <end>
<begin> i dunno could be a sequel <end>	<begin> sequel tho muje patha bhi nahi <end>
<begin> like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman <end>	<begin> asal mein tho superman nahi martha voh batman ke role ko hibernated kiya <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>

<begin> what was your favorite part <end>	<begin> kaun sa part tumhe acha lagga <end>
<begin> i liked when mike and sully didnt finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways <end>	<begin> muje acha lagga jab mike aur ully ne program khatam nahi kiya aur phir bhi mehnat se tarraki ki <end>
<begin> me too it was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways i liked how the movie expanded on the monster world <end>	<begin> meje bhi veh ik parerna thi aur darshata tha ki tum apne khawab pure kar sakte ho jaisa movie ne batae monster world main muje vo acha lagga <end>
<begin> yes the first movie only gave one facet of the world while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree <end>	<begin> haan pehli movie main sirk ik hissa dikha tha tha us duniya ka jab ki dusri ne sathapna kaafi had tak kar di <end>
<begin> when i heard they were making another monsters inc movie i expected a sequel not a prequel but i ended up loving it did you see it in theatres <end>	<begin> jab maine sunna k vo ik aur monsters inc move bana rahe hai mainse uska agla hissa samja jab ki vi usse peche ki kahani hai par muje acha lagga kya tumne theater main dekhi thi <end>
<begin> i dont think we saw it in the theatre i think we rented it its been a while though i should show it to my kids they would probably like it <end>	<begin> muje nahi lagta humne theater main dekhi thi shayad hume kiraye pe li thi kaafi samma ho gaya main ajarur apne bachon ko dikhaunga <end>

<begin> do you like mike or sulley better <end>	<begin> tumhe mike ya sulley kaun better lagta hai <end>
<begin> oh good question i think i like mike more hes weirdly optimistic <end>	<begin> oh achchhaa sawaal mujhe lagta hain ki main mike ko zyada pasand karta hoon wo weirdly optimistic hai <end>
<begin> how about you <end>	<begin> aur tumhe <end>
<begin> i like mike because hes funnier he had some of the best lines in the first movie <end>	<begin> mujhe mike pasand kyunki wo zyada funny hai first movie mein uski lines best thee <end>
<begin> he is so funny <end>	<begin> wo kafi funny hai <end>
<begin> i always liked john goodmans voice acting for sully though its perfect for a big fluffy monster <end>	<begin> halaki mujhe sully mai john goodman ki voice acting hamesha aachi lagi ye bade fuffy monster ke liye perfect hai <end>
<begin> the part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard <end>	<begin> pehli movie ke end mai jab wo muh se microphone nikalta hai usse mere bacche bohot zor se haste hein <end>
<begin> i agree john goodman was a great choice for sulley <end>	<begin> mai agree karta hun john goodman sulley ke liye behtareen choice tha <end>
<begin> hahah i bet <end>	<begin> hahah shart lagata hun <end>
<begin> i love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest that was pretty neat <end>	<begin> mujhe prequel mai wo darane wali machine pasand hai jise students ko darana tha contest ke liye wo kafi saaf tha <end>
<begin> yeah though i was really disappointed with sulley for cheating <end>	<begin> han halaki mai bohot niraash tha sulley ke cheating karne se <end>
<begin> i was too that broke my heart i cried when that happened <end>	<begin> mai bhi tha usne mera dil tod diya mai roya jab wo hua <end>
<begin> it was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike <end>	<begin> ye bohot cruel tha jo mike ke upar kiya gya <end>
<begin> it seemed a little out of character for sulley but i guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving <end>	<begin> ye sulley ke character se alag lga par mujhe lagta hai unhe ek aakhiri conflict ka source chahiye tha un dono ke beech plot ko chalate rehne ke liye <end>
<begin> i agree it was probably my least favorite part of the movie i feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon yeh tho mera least favorite part hein is movie mein muje lagtha hein ki is story ko alag direction mein lekhe gaya hein <end>
<begin> for sully to trick mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful <end>	<begin> sully nei mike ko trick kar rahi thi ki voh scary hein jo bahut hurt ful hein <end>
<begin> i do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though thats a good message that disney started doing with the princess and the frog <end>	<begin> muje unka dream ko achieve karne ke liye unka work bahut pasand hein disney ka ache message hein voh the princess and the frog se shuru kiye <end>
<begin> me too i like that common thread between the two movies i think it was executed better in this though because they really did start from the very bottom of monsters inch <end>	<begin> muje bhi muje unka common thread us movies ke between pasand hein kuch better execute kiye hein kyon ki voh monsters ka bottom se shuru huva <end>
<begin> and it explains why theyre always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie they were once in that same position <end>	<begin> aur voh explain karthe ki kyon voh janitors ke saath ache hein in original movie mein sab sam position mein they <end>

<begin> the movie is a bit unique as it uses d animation its a coming of age comedy the same producers of lilo and stitch created it <end>	<begin> is movie tho d animation ka hein aur voh unique se hei yeh age comedy ka aur same producers yaani lilo aur stitch ka created hey <end>
<begin> it seemed to do ok it got a <number> on rotten tomatoes but an a in cinema score <end>	<begin> acha tho <number> rotten tomatoes neh deya tha lekin yeh tho a nikla <end>
<begin> i see that sounds pretty good then you said it was animated but do you know who provides the voices <end>	<begin> acha tho yeh kaafi acha rahega aap animated bole lekin kon uska voice deya <end>
<begin> actually some well known names come to mind like hiccup is played by jay baruchel and gerard butler as the chief viking america ferrera plays a friend of hiccup hiccup is the main character of course <end>	<begin> actually kuch jaan pehechan ka naam mera mind mei aa raha hei yaani hiccup ka role tho jay baruchel ne kiya aur gerard butler ka role chief viking aur america ferrere ka role tho hiccup ka friend ne kiya actually hiccup tho main character hein <end>
<begin> thats really cool im sure they do a great job i really like animated movies so i might have to check that one out sometime <end>	<begin> oh tho acha rehega muje animated movies dekhna pasand hein mein kuch movies aisa dekha hoon <end>
<begin> i have actually seen it and i would recommend it <end>	<begin> mein tho dekh chuka hoon aur mein is movie ko recommend karunga <end>
<begin> you mentioned that he befriends a dragon can you tell me anything more about that <end>	<begin> jaise aap kahe vaise uska friend hi dragon hein kya aur kuch uska baare mein aap batha sakthe ho <end>
<begin> sure the dragons name is night fury and the movie doesnt have much of a storyline but it has battles between tamed and evil ones <end>	<begin> jarur dragon ka naam hein night fury aur us movie mein kafi storyline nahi hein lakin uska tamed aur evil one ka battles chal raha hein <end>
<begin> do youlike dragons <end>	<begin> kya tumhe dragons pasand hai <end>
<begin> i see that sounds pretty interesting though i do dragons are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to get a film with a good one <end>	<begin> i see kaafi interesting sound karta hai mujhe pasand hai dragons usually bad guys rahte hai movies me to kisi film agar wo acche hai to kaafi cool baat hai <end>
<begin> and vikings as well it sounds like a very unique setting <end>	<begin> aur vikings bhi hai kaafi unique setting hai <end>
<begin> yes the isle of berk is their village and they are afraid of the dragons because they steal their livestock so when they come upon the dragons they usually kill them <end>	<begin> haan isle of berk unka village hai aur wo dragons se darte hai kyuki wo unke livestock chura lete hai to jab wo aate hai usually unko maar dete hai <end>
<begin> oh no but i guess hiccup finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end <end>	<begin> oh nahi but i guess hiccup ko pata chalega sab dragons bure nahi hote <end>
<begin> see hiccup is scrawny and cant fight because he is scrawny so he makes things apparatuses if you will <end>	<begin> see hiccup bahut scrawny hai aur isliye fight nahi kar sakta to wo cheeze banata hai apparatus bol sakte ho <end>
<begin> but he isnt very good at it <end>	<begin> but wo bahut accha nahi hai isme <end>
<begin> i see an awkward kid makes a friend of a dragon huh that does sound very interesting <end>	<begin> i see ek awkward kid dragon ko dost bana leta hai sahi me interesting sound karta hai <end>
<begin> i usually like animated films that have a good main character so this might be right up my alley <end>	<begin> mujhe usually animated movies jisme accha main character ho pasand aati hai to bilkul mere type ki movie hai <end>
<begin> so during one of those attacks hiccup shoots at a dragon and believes he has shot it down finds it later not dead but damaged helpes the dragon fly again then finds out that thedragonsare being bullied by a bigger one <end>	<begin> to aise hi attacks k duaran hiccup ek dragon ko shoot karta hai aur maanta hai k usne maar diya baad me pata chalta hai k maara nahi but damage kiya hai wo us dragon ko wapas udne me help karta hai aur pata lagata hai k sabhi dragons ko ek bada dragon bully kar raha hai <end>
<begin> i see i bet he works together with his new dragon friend to help them out then <end>	<begin> i see mai sart lagata hu ki wo apne naye gragon mitra ko madad karne ke liye milkar kam karenge <end>
<begin> so hiccup and his friends decide they are going to help out hiccups friendly dragon and they all learn how to train awkward dragons and go off to fight the biggest dragon which they call red death <end>	<begin> isliye hiccup aur uske friends ne decide kiya ki wo biggest dragon ki jisko red death kaha jata hai unse ladai ke liye wo hiccups friendly dragon ko madad karenge aur wo log sikhenge ki awkward dragons ko kaise train kiya jaye <end>
<begin> that does sound cool <end>	<begin> wo cool sunai padta hai <end>

<begin> who was your favorite character in the movie <end>	<begin> movie me tumhara favorite character kaun tha <end>
<begin> i really liked alex <end>	<begin> mujhe alex bahut accha laga <end>
<begin> why is that <end>	<begin> aisa kyu <end>
<begin> he was a complex character not straight up good guy or bad guy <end>	<begin> wo complex character tha bilkul good guy ya bad guy nahi tha <end>
<begin> do you feel the movie had a fitting ending or was it a cliffhanger <end>	<begin> tumhe kya lagta hai movie ki fitting ending thi ya cliffhanger thi <end>
<begin> as an historical drama there was little chance for a cliffhanger so it ended well <end>	<begin> kyuki wo historical drama hai usme thoda chance tha cliffhanger ka to wo acchi end hui <end>
<begin> thats good do you feel that all the characters were well developed <end>	<begin> accha kya tumhe lagta hai sabhi characters well developed the <end>
<begin> no the gibson character could have been better developed <end>	<begin> nahi gibson character thoda aur develop kiya jaa sakta tha <end>
<begin> what about casting choices were the actors all pretty decent for their character roles <end>	<begin> casting choices ke baare mein kya khayaal hai kya wo sab actors kafi decent they unke character roles ke liye <end>
<begin> they were with some surprises like harry styles making the cast <end>	<begin> han wo they saath mein harry styles jaise ka cast mein hona surprise tha <end>
<begin> do you feel they were pretty accurate with the props and clothing for the time period portrayed since it was a historical drama <end>	<begin> kya tumhe lagta hai ki props aur clothings kafi accurate they jo time period dikhaya gaya uske liye kyunki ye ek historical drama tha <end>
<begin> yes not only in the military side but also in regards to the characterization of civilian life <end>	<begin> han na sirf military side par lekin civilian life ke characterization ke hisaab se bhi <end>
<begin> what was your favorite part of the whole movie <end>	<begin> tumhare liye movie ka sabse favorite part kya tha <end>
<begin> the scene where tommy alex and gibson hide inside a trawler <end>	<begin> wo scene jisme tommy alex aur gibson trawler ke andar hide karte hain <end>
<begin> okay <end>	<begin> acha <end>
<begin> are you interested in watching the film <end>	<begin> kya tum film dekhne mein interested ho <end>
<begin> alex seems like a really cool character especially with all the realism described <end>	<begin> alex kafi cool character lagta hai khaskar jis realism se usey describe kiya gaya hai <end>
<begin> so yes i am interested <end>	<begin> ha me interested hu <end>
<begin> i wonder why there is a gap in the rotton tomatoes score and the metacritic score for wonder woman <end>	<begin> i wonder rotten tomatoes score aur metacritic score me wonder woman k liye itna gap kyu hai <end>
<begin> hello that is very strange maybe they have different audiences did you originally see this as a war movie i guess i personally separate war movies from super hero movies <end>	<begin> hello ye kaafi strange hai maybe unki different audience hai kya tumne originally ise war movie type se dekha i guess personally main war movies aur super hero movies ko seperate karta hu <end>
<begin> i do that too i think of them both as different genres even though wonder woman was set during world war <number> <end>	<begin> main bhi wahi karta hu main dono ko alag genre maanta hu bhale hi wonder woman world war <number> k duaran set thi <end>
<begin> yeah i could see them grouping it together i just usually separate them i enjoy the actors though gal gadot and chris pine are great how did you feel about their choices <end>	<begin> haan main unhen ek saath samoohabaddh karate hue dekh sakata tha main aamataur par unhen alag karata hoon main actors ka aanand leta hoon haalaanki gal gadot aur chris pine mahaan hain aapako unakee pasand ke baare mein kaisa laga <end>
<begin> i thought the casting was great even though this was the first time i ever heard of gal gadot <end>	<begin> mujhe laga ki kaasting bahut achchhee thee haalaanki yah pahalee baar tha jab mainne gal gadot ke baare mein suna <end>
<begin> i was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a dc film haha usually marvel runs the place <end>	<begin> haalaanki main hairaan tha ki yah ek dc movie haaha ko dekhate hue sirtiks ke saath bahut achchhee tarah se praapt hua tha aamataur par marvel jagah chalaata hai <end>
<begin> i agree i think one of the reasons it was well received was because wonder woman was trying to end the war instead of contributing to a growing conflict <end>	<begin> main sahamat hoon mujhe lagata hai ki isaka ek kaaran yah tha ki ise achchhee tarah se praapt kiya gaya tha kyonki wonder woman badhate sangharsh mein yogadaan dene ke bajaay yuddh ko samaapt karane kee koshish kar rahee thee <end>
<begin> yeah a lot of the marvel movies tend to just make up a conflict and then go with it instead of going off an existing one i enjoyed it though it is interesting the difference in opinions though i dont know if i would see a second one <end>	<begin> haan bahut see marvel movies sirph ek sangharsh karane ke lie hotee hain aur phir ek maujooda band hone ke bajaay isake saath jaatee hain mainne haalaanki isaka aanand liya haalaanki yah raay mein antar dilachasp hai mujhe nahin pata ki kya main ek doosare ko dekhoonga <end>
<begin> i think if patty jenkins directs a sequel it would be as good as the first one she did a great job with this movie <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki agar patty jenkins ek seekval ka nirdeshan karatee hai to yah pahale vaale kee tarah achchha hoga iss movie ke saath unhonne bahut achchha kaam kiya <end>
<begin> thats true if they can keep the cast and crew together i think the chances of it being a hit increase i believe thats more then <number> exchanges weve had about the movie now <end>	<begin> yah sach hai agar ve kalaakaaron aur chaalak dal ko ek saath rakh sakate hain to mujhe lagata hai ki yah ek hit virddhi kee sambhaavana hai mera maanana hai ki <number> se adhik eksachenjon ke baad ab hamane movie ke baare mein socha hai <end>
<begin> the document just updated for me one of the things that caught my eye of the movie is how the time period was depicted especially with how princess diana received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies it is an interesting disconnect <end>	<begin> dastaavez sirph mere lie apadet kiya gaya movie kee meree nazar mein aane vaalee cheejon mein se ek yah hai ki samay avadhi ko kaise chitrit kiya gaya tha khaasakar princess diana ko photographic plet kaise milee jabaki ab ham selphee le sakate hain yah ek dilachasp disconnect hai <end>
<begin> oh mine just updated too sorry about that i think thats interesting and a good period for the film i think the mythology involved behind it was very intriguing <end>	<begin> oh mera bhee adyatan kiya gaya is baare mein kshama karen mujhe lagata hai ki movie kelie dilachasp aur ek achchhee avadhi hai mujhe lagata hai ki isake peechhe shaamil pauraanik katha bahut pecheeda thee <end>
<begin> i agree usually whenever greek or roman mythology is presented in a movie it is dense and opaque but it was easily understood in wonder woman <end>	<begin> main sahamat hoon aamataur par jab bhee kisee philm mein greek ya roman pauraanik kathaon ko prastut kiya jaata hai to vah ghanee aur apaaradarshee hotee hai lekin wonder woman mein yah aasaanee se samajh mein aa gaya <end>
<begin> yeah introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how theyre presented its interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect mankind <end>	<begin> haan is tarah kee avadhaaranaon ko pesh karana nishchit roop se kabhee kabhee paalan karane ke lie kathin ho sakata hai ki ve kaise prastut karate hain yah dilachasp hai ki zoo ne maanav jaati kee raksha ke lie amejan yoddhaon ko chuna <end>
<begin> the way ares was punished was also interesting with only zeus able to wound him in the battle <end>	<begin> jis tarah se eres ko dandit kiya gaya tha vah bhee dilachasp tha keval zeus ne use ladaee mein ghaayal karane mein saksham kiya <end>
<begin> i liked that it was only them left zues and ares had to fight to save mankind it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war <end>	<begin> mujhe yah pasand aaya ki yah keval vaam zeus aur eres ko maanav jaati ko bachaane ke lie ladana tha isane ise us samay ke saath dilachasp bana diya jahaan itihaas mein pahalee baar hamane vishv yuddh kiya tha <end>
<begin> i thought it was interesting that the american pilot crashed near south america connecting world war <number> to the amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion <end>	<begin> mujhe laga ki yah dilachasp tha ki american chalak dakshin american ke paas durghatanaagrast ho gaya pratham vishv yuddh ko amozon se jodakar meree raay mein philm mein bahut achchha kaam kiya gaya <end>
<begin> yeah it seems they did a very good job of having the plot points connect with real world situations the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare technology really gives you a sense of good side bad side <end>	<begin> haan aisa lagata hai ki unhonne vaastavik duniya kee sthitiyon se jude kathaanak binduon ko jodane ka ek bahut achchha kaam kiya hai is dveep par phir se jangalon dvaara aakraman kiya ja raha hai taaki unakee yuddh takaneek ko aage badhaaya ja sake aur aapako vaastav mein achchhe paksh bure paksh ka ehasaas ho <end>
<begin> especially with the germans trying to engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had i think that ties very well into everyones ingrained mortality <end>	<begin> vishesh roop se germans ke paas raasaayanik hathiyaaron ke ek bhee ghaatak sanskaran ko injeeniyar karane kee koshish kar raha tha mujhe lagata hai ki har kisee kee nirbaadh mrtyu dar mein bahut achchha sambandh ha <end>
<begin> i also like that hippolyta allowed her sister to train diana giving her the extra she needed to really stand out from the amazonian warriors <end>	<begin> mujhe yah bhee pasand hai ki hippolyta ne apanee bahan ko daayana ko prashikshit karane kee anumati dee thee jisase use vah atirikt dene kee jaroorat thee jo vaastav mein amaajoniyan yoddhaon se baahar khade hone kee jaroorat thee <end>
<begin> i felt that was a very feminist inspired scene which i really enjoyed seeing in the film that was a big dynamic in how the world war was almost exclusively fought by men with the sole woman wanting to end it <end>	<begin> mujhe laga ki yah ek bahut hee naareevaadee prerit drshy tha jise philm mein dekhakar mujhe bahut maja aaya yah ek bada gatisheel tha ki kaise vishv yuddh lagabhag vishesh roop se purushon dvaara lada gaya tha ekamaatr mahila jo ise samaapt karana chaahatee thee <end>
<begin> that is a really interesting point that i havent considered i know that the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys that <end>	<begin> yah vaastav mein ek dilachasp bindu hai jis par mainne vichaar nahin kiya hai mujhe pata hai ki philm ko vyaapak roop se naareevaad ko ek aavaaj dene ke lie ghoshit kiya gaya tha lekin yah bindu vaastav mein thos hai <end>
<begin> i really didnt except sir patrick to ares its an interesting dynamic that really came out <end>	<begin> mujhe vaastav mein sar patrick se ares kee ummeed nahin thee yah ek dilachasp gatisheel hai jo vaastav mein saamane aaya hai <end>
<begin> i thought the scene when sir patrick revealed himself as ares also influenced that where he wanted to use the godkiller sword to destroy humanity but wonder woman said no <end>	<begin> maine socha jis scene main sir patrick reveal kiya kyonki ares ne bi influence kiya tha jahan woh godkiller sword ko use karke humanity ko destroy karna chatha tha lekin wonder woman ne no kah diya <end>
<begin> yeah i really didnt except wonder women to be the godkiller although it does make sense <end>	<begin> yeah main really expect nahin kiya wonder woman hi godkiller thi although isme koi sense nahin hai <end>
<begin> i think that was another big feminist point in the movie in my opinion the ending of the movie was very heartfelt and connected how wars of the past influence our present when princess diana emailed bruce wayne <end>	<begin> i think woh ek bada feminist point hai movie hai mere opinion haimovie ka ending bahut heartfelt tha aur connect kiya ki kaise past wars hamare present ko influence karte hain princess diana ne email kiya bruce wayne ko <end>
<begin> yeah i think the dynamic between the all the characters fits really well linking it all togheter from diana and bruce to diana and ares and ares and zues <end>	<begin> haan mujhe lagta hai characters ki dynamics acchi fit karti hai sabhi ko link karte hue diana aur bruce se lekar diana aur ares thak aur ares aur zues <end>
<begin> the casting helped make the movie incredible the charisma and chemistry between every character showed the scene where steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well i think <end>	<begin> casting ne help kia movie ko incredible banane ke liye charisma aur chemistry ke andar character dikhta haijo scene jahan steve ne bomber ko hijack kiya acchi tarah dikhta hai <end>
<begin> steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main role <end>	<begin> steve ka bhi accha interesting role hai movie mein bahut support deta hai lekin phir bhi main role nahi leta <end>
<begin> his character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion <end>	<begin> uska charcter excellent supporting charcter hai mere khayal se <end>

<begin> indeed plus it was the first time ever that a female director directed a comic book superhero movie <end>	<begin> indeed saath main pahli baar koi female director directed a comic book superhero movie <end>
<begin> ah i didnt catch that thats right it makes me want to see the rest of the upcoming decu movies more <end>	<begin> ah i didnt catch that woh sahi hai ab lagta hain yeh mujhe want to see the rest of the upcoming decu movies more <end>

<begin> the greek mythology was great but i thought it was a bit confusing <end>	<begin> the greek mythology was great but mujhe lagta hai it was a bit confusing <end>

<begin> true people went for the action for sure i personally like movies with a bit more of a back story <end>	<begin> true log surely action k liye gaye hai personally mujhe thoda bahut back story wali movies acchi lagti hai <end>
<begin> right i wouldnt mind an extra <number> <number> minutes with more detailed story about ares and zeus <end>	<begin> bilkul main ares aur zeus k baare me <number> <number> minute ki detailed story mind nahi karta hai <end>

<begin> yeah there was alot of feminine cheering in the theater for that scene <end>	<begin> haan us scene me theatre me kaafi feminine cheering thi <end>
<begin> i hated that her aunt died when the germans invaded though <end>	<begin> mujhe german invasion me uski aunt ka marna pasand nahi aaya <end>
<begin> yeah that was sad pretty unavoidable though to advance the story and give gravitas to wws journey <end>	<begin> han ye sad tha kafi unavoidable tha magar story ko advance karne ke liye aur ww ki journey ko gravitas dene ke liye <end>
<begin> how did you like sir patrick <end>	<begin> tumhe sir patrick kaisa laga <end>

<begin> i saw that coming too predictable that he was ares i thought <end>	<begin> mujhe pata chal gaya tha ye bohat predicatable tha ki wo ares tha i thought <end>
<begin> right but theres only so much they can do its a huge movie designed for the masses not for those with discriminating tastes <end>	<begin> right lekin wo bhi kitna karein ye ek huge movie thi masses ke liye discriminating tastes walo ke liye nahi <end>

<begin> yeah the ending reminded me of captn america with his story in the past and waking up to the modern day world <end>	<begin> han movie ki ending se mujhe captain america ki ending yaad agyi sath mein uski past ki story aur modern world mein jaagne ki <end>
<begin> yes but from different universes <end>	<begin> han par alag universes se <end>

<begin> true cant wait till the next installment <end>	<begin> true main next istallment tak wait nahi kar sakta <end>
<begin> but with cp taking the bomber away to detonate is just like captn america going to the arctic to destroy his bom b <end>	<begin> lekin cp bambaare karane kelie visphot karane kelie door le ja raha hai jaise captain america apane bomb ko nasht karane kelie arctic ja raha hai <end>
<begin> yeah im sure itll be a great one <end>	<begin> haan mujhe yakeen hai ki yah bahut achchaa hoga <end>
<begin> for sure many similarities i have to say i liked wonder woman more so than batman vs superman <end>	<begin> mujhe yakeen hai ki kae samanataon kelie mujhe wonder woman ko batman vs superman se adhik pasand karana hoga <end>

<begin> is there alot of singing in the movie i dont particular like musical type movies but my kids do <end>	<begin> kya movie me bahut sare gane hai main vishesh rup se musical type movies pasand nahin karata lekin mere bachche karate hain <end>
<begin> theres a song written just for this movie by pharell its not too much music and its probably too hard for kids to memorize sing constantly but there are characters called minions that dance and act very silly <end>	<begin> is movie ke lie pharell ne sirf ek geet likha hai isme bahut jyada music nahin hai aur shayad bachchon ko yaad rakhana aur lagatar gaana ga pana bahut mushkil hai lekin isame minions ka kirdar hain jo dance aur bahut murkhatapurn abhinay karata hai <end>

<begin> great do i need to watch any other dc comic movies prior to watching this one <end>	<begin> mahaan kya mujhe ise dekhane se pahale kisee any dc comik movies dekhane kee jaroorat hai <end>
<begin> i cant honestly say however as a critic noted its better than man of steel but not as good as the dark knight <end>	<begin> mai sach nhi keh skta halaki ye man of steel se better hai lekin dark knight jitni achi nhi hai <end>
<begin> who are the lead actors <end>	<begin> lead actors kon hai <end>
<begin> it follows <number> s man of steel so you would probably need to see it just to be safe <end>	<begin> ye <number> ki man of steel ko follow krti hai so safely dekhna <end>
<begin> batman superman and even wonder woman makes an appearance <end>	<begin> batman superman aur wonder woman bhi hai isme <end>
<begin> haha do you know which actors play batman superman and wonder woman in this movie <end>	<begin> haha kya aap jante ho ki is film mai konse actor batman superman aur wonder womanrole ker rhe hai <end>
<begin> ben affleck plays batman bruce wayne henry cavill plays clark kent superman gal gadot stars in the film as well as diane lane as martha kent and amy adams as louis lane are you a fan of any of those actors <end>	<begin> ben affleck batmanka bruce wayne henry cavill clark kent superman ka role paly ker rhe hai gal gadot film mai diane lane martha kent ka aur amy adams louis lane ka role play ker rhe hai kya tum in actors ke fan ho <end>
<begin> all but ben affleck lest super hero movie i saw him in was daredevil and that was rough lets hope hes better in this <end>	<begin> sabhi lekin ben affleck ki last super hero movie main usse daredevils mai dekh tha wo mote tha hoskta hai isme kuch acha kam hoga <end>
<begin> though i am a michael keaton fan when it comes to batman i suspect anyone playing batman who is not keaton will be weird to me <end>	<begin> halaki me batman mai michael keaton ka fan hu muje lgta hai ki koi or batman ka paly nhi ker payge jo michel keaton ne kiya <end>
<begin> most of the critics wasnt too fond of it but cinemascore have it a rating of b which i feel is about right for this film <end>	<begin> bhote se critics ko ye pasand nhi tha par cinemascore mai rating b thi muje lgta hai ye sahi thi <end>
<begin> have you seen it <end>	<begin> kya tumne dekhi hai <end>
<begin> i have and would grade it a solid b just as cinemascore did are you a fan of director zack snyder <end>	<begin> maine is solid b grade karta jaise k cinemascore ne kiya kya tum director zack snyder k fan ho <end>
<begin> im not sure what other movies has he directed <end>	<begin> main sure nahi hu usne aur kaunsi movies direct ki hai <end>
<begin> he directed batman vs superman the film takes place <number> months after the battle between general zod and superman superman becomes a controversial figure while clark kent learns of batmans form of justice and seeks to expose him via daily planet articles <end>	<begin> usne batman v superman direct ki hai wo movie general zod aur superman k battle k <number> month baad hoti hai superman ek controversial figure ban jata hai aur clark kent ko batman k justice k tareeke k baare me pata chalta hai aur wo use daily planet k articles me expose karna chahta hai <end>
<begin> has he directed anything else besides the batman or superman movies <end>	<begin> kya usne batman aur superman movie k alawa kuch direct kiya hai <end>
<begin> i cant honestly say i know he directed this film while david s goyer and chris terrio cowrote it <end>	<begin> honestly main bol nahi sakta hai mujhe pata hai k usne ye film direct ki hai aur david s goyer aur chris terrio ne write ki hai <end>
<begin> batman and superman are enemies in this film <end>	<begin> kya batman aur superman is film me enemies hai <end>
<begin> they are lex luthor who is obsessed with defeating superman basically manipulates them into fighting each other <end>	<begin> wo hai lex luthor jo superman ko harane ko lekar obsessed hai basically dono ko ek dusre ko fight karne me manipulate kar deta hai <end>
<begin> whose side is wonder woman on <end>	<begin> wonder woman kis side pe rahti hai <end>
<begin> well to be honest batman has superman beat and just before he can kill superman superman utters save martha to which lane enterenters and explains martha is his mother batman rescues martha while superman confronts luther on the scout ship at this point wonder woman hasnt debuted yet <end>	<begin> well to be honest batman superman ko hara deta hai aur jaise hi wo superman ko maarne wala rahta hai superman bolta hai save martha to lane andar aati hai aur explain karti hai k martha uski maa hai batman martha ko rescue karta hai aur superman scout ship pe luthor ko confront karta hai is point pe wonder woman ab tak debut nahi ki hai <end>
<begin> dang crazy that batman has superman beat isnt batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets superman at least has real super powers you would think that would give him a one up did batman have kryptonite or something <end>	<begin> dang crazy batman superman ko hara deta hai kya wo bas ek millionaire nahi juske pas bhut fancy gadget hai superman k paas at least real super powers hai koi bhi sochega k wo superman jeetega kya batman k paas kryptonite ya kuch tha <end>
<begin> i do very much agree with you it is puzzling but batman has a spear he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the save martha line halting batman from killing him <end>	<begin> main aapase bahut sahamat hoon yah hairaan karane vaala hai lekin baitamain ke paas ek bhaala hai jisase vah suparamain ko maarane kee yojana banaata hai isase pahale ki vah sev maartha lain ka upayog karata hai baitamain ko maarane se rok deta hai <end>
<begin> do the join forces after that <end>	<begin> kya usake baad sena mein shaamil hote hain <end>
<begin> they <end>	<begin> ve <end>
<begin> they do thankfully batman actually saves martha while superman travels to the scout ship to confront luther <end>	<begin> ve shukr manaate hain baitamain vaastav mein maartha ko bachaata hai jabaki suparamain ka saamana loothar ke saath skaut jahaaj tak jaata hai <end>
<begin> does he kill luther <end>	<begin> kya vah ko luther maarata hai <end>
<begin> luther was also the one who kidnapped martha he doesnt kill luther but luther is arrested to which batman confronts him while hes in prison warning that hell always be watching <end>	<begin> luther bhee vahee tha jisane maartha ka apaharan kiya tha vah loothar ko nahin maarata hai lekin loothar ko giraphtaar kar liya jaata hai jisamen baitamain ne jel mein rahane ke dauraan usaka saamana kiya chetaavanee dee ki vah hamesha dekhata rahega <end>
<begin> so basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise <end>	<begin> to mool roop se phrainchaizee mein ek aur philm ke lie ek opaning chhod raha hoon <end>
<begin> ive heard debates on supermans and batmans outfits in this movie some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b eloved originals what are your thoughts on this <end>	<begin> mainne is philm mein suparamain aur baitamain ke aautaphit par bahas sunee hai kuchh ka kahana hai ki ve kamaal ke hain aur kuchh kahate hain ki ve haasyaaspad hain aur bahut alag roop mein unake b ailovaid mool hain is par aapake vichaar kya hain <end>
<begin> they do sadly superman dies however bruce wayne intends to form a team of metahumans starting with the metahumans he found in luthors files to protect the world in sueprmans absence <end>	<begin> ve karate hain aphasos kee baat hai ki suparamain kee mrtyu ho jaatee hai haalaanki broos ven ne metaahumans kee ek teem banaane ka iraada kiya metahumans ke saath shuroo karate hue unhonne lyoopor kee phailon mein sooparamain kee anupasthiti mein duniya kee raksha karane ke lie paaya <end>
<begin> while it did seem like <number> minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together i still found it better than man of steel <end>	<begin> jabaki yah aisa lagata tha jaise ek bade aadamee ka do minat mein ek saath do gudiyon ko pakadana mujhe abhee bhee main oph steel se behatar laga <end>
<begin> wait superman dies how <end>	<begin> rukoo superman maar gaya keise <end>
<begin> well to be honest at the end of the film the dirt atop sueprmans coffin does begin to levitate i think were at the finish line i enjoyed chatting with you about batman vs superman i highly recommend you seeing it one day if you agree with cinemascore they rated it a b so i think youll enjoy it and encourage you to watch it take care and have a great day <end>	<begin> bahut imandaari se film ke aakhir mei dirt superman kocoffin mei rakh deta hai socho ki ham aakhari line mei hai hamare saath batman or superman ke bare mei baat karne ko maja le mei aapko ek din isko dekhane ki salah deta hu yadi aap sahmat hai to filma ka score b hai mere khayal de aap pasand karoge aap apna khayal rakhe or aapka din achcha ho <end>
<begin> jaws is a very good movie even though it is older <end>	<begin> agar old vi hai tab vi jaws kaafi achi movie hai <end>
<begin> jaws was made in <number> and stars roy scheider <end>	<begin> jaw <number> ko banaya gya tha aur usme roy scheider actor tha <end>
<begin> how was the horror element <end>	<begin> horror element kaisa tha <end>

<begin> no i did not know that <end>	<begin> nehi main nehi janta tha <end>
<begin> it was written by peter benchley <end>	<begin> ye peter benchley write ki thi <end>
<begin> hows the acting <end>	<begin> acting kaisa raha <end>
<begin> i suppose the acting is good due to the direction of steven spielberg <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta acting achi hai kyoki steven spielberg director hai <end>
<begin> does the shark do a lot of damage <end>	<begin> shaark bahut adhik nukasaan karatee hai <end>
<begin> it starts with the shark pulling a woman that is skinny dipping down in the ocean <end>	<begin> isakee shuruaat shaark dvaara samudr mein dubakee lagaane vaalee ek mahila ko kheenchane se hotee hai <end>
<begin> her name is chrissie watkins and her remains are found on shore the next day <end>	<begin> usaka naam kris votakins hai aur usake avashesh agale din kinaare par mile <end>
<begin> that sound scary <end>	<begin> vah aavaaj daraavanee <end>
<begin> what do they do about the shark <end>	<begin> shaark ke baare mein ve kya karate hain <end>
<begin> i know of course then the police chief wants to close the beach for safety but the mayor says no due to the tourist season and summer economy <end>	<begin> mujhe pata hai beshak pulis pramukh suraksha ke lie samudr tat ko band karana chaahate hain lekin paryatan seejan aur garmiyon kee arthavyavastha ke kaaran meyar nahin kahate hain <end>
<begin> what i cant believe is that because of the mayor the coroner changes his ruling from shark attack to boat attack <end>	<begin> mujhe vishvaas nahin hota ki mahaapaur kee vajah se koronar shaark ke hamale se lekar naav ke hamale tak ke apane phaisale ko badal deta hai <end>
<begin> wow what ashame <end>	<begin> vaah kya sharm aatee hai <end>
<begin> the place a bounty on the shark after he attacks another person <end>	<begin> vah shaark par ek inaam rakhata hai jab vah kisee any vyakti par hamala karata hai <end>
<begin> did someone take it <end>	<begin> kya kisee ne liya <end>
<begin> the local fisherman do catch a shark a tiger shark they assume that thats the killer shark <end>	<begin> sthaaneey machhuaare ek shaark ek baagh shaark ko pakadate hain ve maanate hain ki yah hatyaara shaark hai <end>
<begin> but i assume that the shark comes again <end>	<begin> lekin mujhe lagata hai ki shaark phir se aata hai <end>
<begin> oh yeah on the fourth of july it comes up and kills the police chiefs son <end>	<begin> oh haan chauthee julaee ko yah aata hai aur pulis pramukh ke bete ko maar deta hai <end>
<begin> did you know that jaws is actually supposed to be a great white shark <end>	<begin> kya aap jaanate hain ki jabade vaastav mein ek mahaan saphed shaark maana jaata hai <end>
<begin> that is intresting <end>	<begin> yah dilachasp hai <end>
<begin> were they able to stop the shark <end>	<begin> kya ve shaark ko rokane mein saksham the <end>
<begin> i think one of the best scenes is when the police chief the shark expert and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunters boat the orca <end>	<begin> mujhe lagata hai ki jab pulis pramukh shaark visheshagy aur shaark shikaaree sabhee ek saath shaark shikaaree naav orka par pahunchate hain to sabase achchha drshy hota hai <end>
<begin> that sounds cool <end>	<begin> yah sunane mein achchha laga <end>
<begin> they finally do at the end they harpoon it while on the orca but it gets away <end>	<begin> ve ant mein karate hain ve orka par rahate hue ise pareshaan karate hain lekin yah door ho jaata hai <end>
<begin> it attacks the boat and eats the shark hunter <end>	<begin> yah naav par hamala karata hai aur shaark shikaaree ko kha jaata hai <end>
<begin> wow that must be scary <end>	<begin> vaah jo daraavana hona chaahie <end>
<begin> then the police chief stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into its mouth and shoots the tank <end>	<begin> phir pulis pramukh ek dabaavayukt skooba taink ko munh mein bharate hain aur taink ko golee maarate hain <end>
<begin> thanks i will watch this movie <end>	<begin> dhanyavaad main yah philm dekhoonga <end>

<begin> i agree im slightly disappointed by the rotten tomatoes score then again it is the first time that pixar has made a prequel film <end>	<begin> main sehmat huin main zara rotten tomatoes ke score se disappointed huin phir se yeh pehli baar hai ki pixar ne ek prequel film bnayi hai <end>
<begin> do you typically watch movies like monsters university <end>	<begin> kya aamtaur par monsters university jaisi movies dekhte ho <end>
<begin> typically no since i generally like to watch anime but if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid then i usually will make a effort to see it <end>	<begin> zyadatar nhi main aamtaur par anime movies dekhta huin lekin jab main bacha tha to ek hi franchise dwara banayi gayi movies dekhta tha to main aamtaur par aisi movies dekhne ki koshish krta huin <end>
<begin> and i agree those scores kinda seem rather low <end>	<begin> aur main maanata hoon ki voh score thode kam lag rahe hain <end>
<begin> i understand just by glancing at the ratings do you think youd make an effort to go see the prequel or would the score discourage you from seeing the film <end>	<begin> main samjhta huin sirf ratings to dekh kar tumhe lagta hai ki iss prequel ko dekhne ki koshish krte ya score tumhe movie dekhne ke liye discourage krte hai <end>
<begin> id still see it despite bad reviews i generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not like if <number> of people say its bad or good i usually wont follow what i hear i just go and experience it for myself and then from there i usually say its cool or say its bad <end>	<begin> main isse bure reviews milne ke baad bhi dekhunga main zayadtar cheezein khud dekh kar decide krna pasand krta huin ki mujhe pasand hai ya nhi jaise agar <number> log kehte hai ki ye buri hai ya achhi main aamtaur par baatein sunn kar unke peeche nhi jata main bas chala jata huin or khud se experience krta huin aur phir main aamtaur par batata huin ke ye badiya hai ya buri <end>
<begin> makes sense i typically only pay attention to the ratings when its a director who i am familiar with if i know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings i usually will wait to hear from friends family before paying to see it <end>	<begin> samajh mein aata hai main jayadatar tab ratings pe dhayan deta huin jab main director ko janta huin agar mujhe pata hai ki aamtaur par unka kam bahut shaandaar hai or uss ek movie ke bahut buri ratings main aamtaur par uspe paise lagane se pehle friends family se sunn leta huin <end>

<begin> looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities <end>	<begin> lagta hai ye movie kafi heavily cartoon fraternities par based hai <end>
<begin> yep <end>	<begin> yep <end>
<begin> i find it odd that pixar has a scene in this movie where sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores doesnt really promote the whole fair play imagine to their age demographic <end>	<begin> muje thoda odd laga is movie mein pixar ke liye yek scene hein jaha sulley tampers with the machine ne better score kiya aajkal ka demographic mein fairplay ne promote nahi kiya <end>
<begin> oozma kappa i cant believe they threw a kappa meme in there <end>	<begin> oozma kappa muje nahi lagtha koi kappa ka meme banega <end>

<begin> idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough <end>	<begin> yeh kuch scary ke tarh bhi ho sakthe <end>
<begin> nope i thought the same i think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph <end>	<begin> nahi muje bhi aise hi kuch lagtha kyon ki is mein kuch gender context nahi hein <end>
<begin> yeah probably <end>	<begin> haan <end>
<begin> well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids <end>	<begin> tho yeh kids ke liye tho safe movie hein <end>
<begin> no i dont think its to make sure theyre scary enough the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university <end>	<begin> nahi muje nahi lagtha yeh itna bhi scary hoga cda ne cop ko form kiya aur usse campus se expulsion karne ke liye university aathe <end>
<begin> although i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there <end>	<begin> thoda hidden adult jokes hein us college aur fraternity ne tho yek ya do slip jarur liya hoga <end>
<begin> ah i see that would make sense <end>	<begin> ah ab hui na baath <end>
<begin> i agree i was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesnt coincide with a kids film and what youd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monsters actions <end>	<begin> mein maantha hoon us cheating portion is movie mein jo skeptical hein lekin kids film ke liye tho bilkul coincide nahi huva is saal ke bachon ko kya sikhane chathe yeh tho pura negative reinforces hein us monsters ka action ka <end>
<begin> true movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them <end>	<begin> sach in dinno mein movies tho itna formulaic tropes hein jo kids ko nahi dekha sakthe <end>
<begin> i hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable <end>	<begin> movies tho fresh aur unpredictable honna mera hope hein <end>
<begin> keep the kids on their toes <end>	<begin> kids ko tho hum hamare toes mein rakhna chahiye <end>
<begin> one can only hope <end>	<begin> har kisi ka hope hein <end>
<begin> and still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it <end>	<begin> smart bhi rehena chahiye jo parents bhi enjoy kar sakthe <end>
<begin> a <number> on a kids movie doesnt seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes <end>	<begin> <number> kids movie tho bad hi hota mera opinion se keyscenes ko badne ke baath <end>
<begin> thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good and still seem better than movies today <end>	<begin> isliye pixar ka purane films acha rahate mera khayal se aur aaj bhi is movies better hey <end>
<begin> thats true i think overall it sounds like a good movie <end>	<begin> yeh tho sach hein overall yeh kuch ache movie sounds kartha <end>

<begin> hi <end>	<begin> hi <end>
<begin> this movie is about how facebook got started by mark zuckerberg its called the social network interesting to watch because its based on real events <end>	<begin> mark zuckerburg ne facebook kaise start kiya movie is baare me hai iska naam hai the social network dekhne me bahut interesting hai kyonki ye real events pe based hai <end>
<begin> i have heard of that movie before <end>	<begin> maine is movie ke baare me pahle bhi suna hai <end>
<begin> although i havent watched it before <end>	<begin> although maine pahle dekhi nahi hai <end>
<begin> it was more popular than the book it was based on the accidental billionaires probably because its a tale of sex money and betrayal stuff we can all identify with <end>	<begin> yah jis kitab par yah aadharit hai usse bhi jyada popular hai the accidental billionaires probably because ye kahani hai sex money aur dhokhe ki wo stuff jiske sath ham sab identify karte hai <end>
<begin> oh that is really interesting <end>	<begin> oh yah to really interesting hai <end>
<begin> it makes it sound more intriguing than before <end>	<begin> yah to pahle se jyada intriguing sound kar raha hai <end>
<begin> have you seen it <end>	<begin> kya aapne dekhi hai <end>
<begin> yes weve all heard of facebook but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising i didnt believe everything i saw in the movie but it held my interest <end>	<begin> yes ham sabne facebook ke bare me suna hai but ye shuru kaise hua uski story kafi surprising hai movie me jo dekha us sab par believe to nahi hua par mera interest isme bana raha <end>
<begin> i think sometimes they add information to movies just to keep the audience entertained <end>	<begin> i think sometime ye movie me kuch information sirf ise interesting aur audience ko entertained rakhne ke liye karte hai <end>
<begin> which is understandable because you dont want a boring movie <end>	<begin> ye understandable hai because koi bhi boring movie nahi chahta <end>
<begin> i had no idea it was a book thogh <end>	<begin> mujhe bilkul idea nahi tha ke wo book hai <end>
<begin> no doubt it is a drama zuckerberg and the current staff werent involved in making the movie it has a kind of dark irony but one of the founders eduardo saverin was consulted by the books author <end>	<begin> beshak ye drama hai zuckerberg aur current staff ka koi involvement nahi tha movie banane isme kuch dark irony hai lekin ek foundereduardo saverin ne book ke author se mulaqat ki <end>
<begin> i am sure there is information that they didnt want to leak in the movie and even the book <end>	<begin> mujhe yaqeen hai kuch information hai jo wo log movie ya book mein leak nahi karna chahte <end>
<begin> so would you recommend seeing this movie it a couple of years old if not older <end>	<begin> toh kya aap ye movie dekhna recommend karte hai ye kuch saal puraani hai agar aur zyada puranni nahi hai toh <end>
<begin> yes its an engaging look at that time period when websites were just getting started some of the lawsuits that came out of those beginnings might still be on going <end>	<begin> haan ye engaging look hai us waqt mein jub websites bus shuru ho rahe thay kuch lawsuits jo jub shuruat mein nikle thay shayad bhi bhi chal rahe hai <end>
<begin> i believe it i remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed i think they have great lawyers to protect themselves though <end>	<begin> mujhe yaqeen hai mujhe yaad hai maine padha tha jub lawsuits file hue thay mere khayal se unke pass khud ko bachanay ache lawyers hai <end>
<begin> the film starts in <number> when zuckerberg was a <number> year old student at harvard he actually created a campus website called facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students <end>	<begin> film shuru hoti hai <number> mein jub zuckerberg <number> saal ka student tha harvard mein usne asal facemash naam ki campus website banayi jisme users female students ke photos ke attractiveness ko rate kar sakte thay <end>
<begin> that is a really good overall description for someone who wants a synapse of the movie <end>	<begin> ye puray taur par bahut acha description hai unlog ke liye jinko movie ka synapse chahiye <end>
<begin> oh thats just the beginning that website was so popular it got the attention of the winklevoss twins who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to harvard so the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague <end>	<begin> ohwo toh bus shuruat hai wo website itni popular hai ke isko winklevoss twins ka attention milajo upper class men thay jinho ne harvard ke liye exclusive dating website banayi <end>
<begin> is the company protected by a patent or some kind of legal documents <end>	<begin> kya company kuch patent ya legal documents ki hifazat me hai <end>
<begin> i dont know but zuckerberg was given <number> months academic probation for hacking into college databases and crashing the harvard computer network so hes aware of what kind of damage a rogue programmer can do <end>	<begin> main nahi jaanta par zukerbreg ko college database ko hack karne aur harward computer network ko crash karne ke liye <number> months ka academic probation mila tha so wo is baat se aware hoge ki rogue programmer kis prakar ka damage kar sakte hai <end>
<begin> as a programmer i could see the damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks <end>	<begin> as a programmer me ye dekh sakta hun ki databases aur networks me hacking se jo nuksaan ho sakta hai <end>
<begin> damage was bound to happen in this situation <end>	<begin> damage is situation me hone ke liye bounded tha <end>
<begin> so you also know that programming knowledge doesnt necessarily translate to business smarts its when zuckerberg gets hooked up with napster co founder sean parker that the business really starts to take off <end>	<begin> so tum bhi ye jaante ho ki business ko smart translate karne ke liye programming ka knowledge necessary nahi hai ye jab zukerberg ne napster ke co founder sean parker se hooked up kiya is se business really me take off karna start karta hai <end>
<begin> i had totally forgotten about using napster i use to always use it had no idea he co f ounded it <end>	<begin> me npaster ko use karne ke baare me totally bhool gaya tha me use hamesa use karne ka aadi hun mujhe koi idea nahi ki wo iska co founder hai <end>
<begin> there were other social networks before the facebook too which is what zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to yale columbia and stanford i liked napster too and had a myspace account but that all changed after parker suggested they drop the and move facebook to palo alto <end>	<begin> facebook ke pehle bhi other social networks the jo ki zuckerberg ne kaha tha jab wo site ko yale columbia aur stanford me expand kar rahe the mujhe nepster bhi pasand hai aur mera myspace ka account bhi hai but ye sab badal gaya jab parker ne suggest kiya facebook to palo alto <end>
<begin> i i also had a myspace account but havent logged in roughly <number> years <end>	<begin> mere pass bhi myspace account hai par maine kabhi hi <number> years me logged in kiya <end>
<begin> been a while for me too parker ended up sharing a house in palo alto with zuckerberg leaving his partner saverin in new york to work on business development meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in california to make a billion dollar company <end>	<begin> mere liye thodi der ho gayi paker ne zuckerberg ke saath house sharing khatm kar di palo alto me apne partner saverin ko new york me hi business development ka kaam karne ke liye chhod diya meanwhile wo california me billion dollar ki company ke business plan ko develop karne lage <end>
<begin> that is crazy to have potentially in a company to make a billion dollar company is mind blowing <end>	<begin> ye crazy tha unke pass company ko million dollar ki company banane ka potential hai jo ki mind blowing hai <end>
<begin> well saverin and the winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company the film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against zuckerberg they eventually settled out of court because zuckerbergs defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury <end>	<begin> well saverin aur winklevoss judwa ne apan interests company me rakhne ka try kiya film me un scenes ko intercut kar diya jisme zuckerberg ke against deposition case the unhone eventually court ke bahar hi settle kar liya zukerberg ke defense sochte hai ki wo jury ko unsympathetic appear hoge <end>
<begin> well if he wasnt going to seem unsympathetic than maybe it was the best choice for the defense <end>	<begin> tho agar voh unsympathetic ke liye nahi jaayega tho defense he uska best choice rehega <end>
<begin> no doubt the film has lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude zuckerberg had towards his collaborators but the end when hes sending a friend request is when it gets really weird <end>	<begin> no doubt film mein tho kahi sordid details hein us founding aur callous ka attitude ke baare mein zuckerberg tho us collaborators ke sa saath hein lekin end mein jab usne usko friend ko request diya tho thoda weird feel huva <end>
<begin> ugh i hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events <end>	<begin> ugh mein end hate kartha kyon ki voh cliff hangers ko nahi choda aur end mein kuch explanation bhi nahi diya us future events ko <end>
<begin> i hear you this ending has to deal with a world where superman is absent and after every one leaves the dirt on top of clarks coffin starts rising into the air how about that <end>	<begin> mein sun liya ending tho world he deal karna chahiye lekin superman absent they aur sabhi yek ke piche chod rahe the clarks ka coffins upper se dirt ud raha tha hava mein kaise huva yeh sab <end>
<begin> thanks <end>	<begin> thanks <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>
<begin> hello so the movie we will be talking about is batman v superman <end>	<begin> hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai batman v superman <end>
<begin> great i havent actually seen that yet but have been really wanting to which actors play batman and superman <end>	<begin> great maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai but sahi me dekhna chahta hu batman aur superman kaun actors bane hai <end>
<begin> the actors are really great and you probably know all of them ben affleck henry cavill amy adams and jesse eisenberg to name a few <end>	<begin> actors sahi me acche hai aur tum probably sabhi ko jaante ho unme se kuch ben affleck henry cavill amy adams and jesse eisenberg hai <end>
<begin> oh that is a great cast henry cavill played superman in the latest superman film right <end>	<begin> oh ye to badhiya cast hai henry cavill ne latest superman film me superman play kiya tha na <end>
<begin> sorry a great cast <end>	<begin> sorry badhiya cast hai <end>
<begin> i am not sure but the film is still a part of the dc extended universe also it will be featuring wonder woman <end>	<begin> main sure to nahi but ye movie dc extended universe ka part hai also isme wonder woman bhi ayegi <end>
<begin> ooh that is excellent i am looking forward to seeing wonder woman are batman and superman enemies at the start of the film <end>	<begin> oooh ye to excellent hai mujhe wonder woman dekhni hai kya film k start me batman aur superman dushman hai <end>
<begin> well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman <end>	<begin> well lex batman ko superman se ladne me manipulate kar deta hai because wo superman ko clone kar ke liye obssessed hai <end>
<begin> oh so batman is supposed to bring superman to lex luthor <end>	<begin> oh to batman superman ko lex luthor k paas leke jata hai <end>
<begin> no that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping by the way did i mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together <end>	<begin> nahi waise nahi hota hai but wo use help karne me manipulate ho jata hai by the way kya maine mention kiya ye pahli movie hai jisme batman aur superman saath me hai <end>
<begin> really the first time that seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long very cool is the story set in metropolis or gotham <end>	<begin> really pahli baar ye jaante huye ke dono character itne time se hai ye cheez to bahut amazing hai bahut cool story metropolis me set hai k gotham me <end>
<begin> the film appears to take place in both cities and batman comes to view superman as a threat to humanity <end>	<begin> aisa lagta hai k film dono cities me hoti hai aur batman ko lagta hai k superman humanity k liye ek threat hai <end>
<begin> that is interesting to have the film set in both cities so batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take superman down <end>	<begin> yeh tho interesting hei yar is film tho dono cities ke hein tho batman ko aasan padega us superman ka duty karne mein <end>
<begin> well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because clark kent aka superman learns of batmans justice methods and tries to expose him all this happening while lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator <end>	<begin> tho is characters ka relationships tho bada complex hein yar kyon ki clark kent ke vaje superman tho batmans ka justice method learn kiya aur usse expose bhi kiya tho lex luthor ne kryptonite ko approval kiya us senator se <end>
<begin> interesting and so i imagine lois lane is in this story if so does she serve a greater purpose does she know both superheroes <end>	<begin> interesting yar mein ab is story ko imagine ki tho uska greater purpose kya hein kya voh dono superheroes ko jaanthi hein <end>
<begin> maybe but i am not sure by the way do you usually care about reviews <end>	<begin> mein kuch sure nahi hoon kya aap reviews ke anusar movie dekhne chalte <end>
<begin> i will often read reviews to see what people have to say but i dont change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews i think that i cant really know unless i see for myself do you care about reviews <end>	<begin> mein tho reviews ke anusar hi jaatha ki kaise logo is movie ko dekhthe lekin mein reviews se apna mind change nahi kartha muje lagtha hein ki yeh sab bakvas hein kya aap review ko care karte <end>
<begin> not usually i like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not i watch in theatres i have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed <end>	<begin> nahi yar mein apne aap judge kartha lekin kuch reviews tho overwhelmingly acha ya bura hota jo muje theathres mein movie dekhte samai relate kartha hoon muje lagtha hein ki is movies ka reviews thoda mixed hein <end>
<begin> did you enjoy this film <end>	<begin> kya aap is film ko enjoy kiya <end>
<begin> i did i really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman <end>	<begin> haan yar muje vakahi mein is scene pasand hein batman tho superman ko kisi tarah manage kar raha tha <end>
<begin> cool i guess thats one of the ultimate questions which one could beat out the other do they team up at all in the film <end>	<begin> cool tho konsa yeh beat karega kya yeh film teamup hoga <end>
<begin> yes in batman chooses to save supermans mother while superman confonts lex <end>	<begin> haan isme tho batman ne superman ka mom ko bachana ke liye choose kiya lekin superman tho lex ko confonts <end>
<begin> oh wow the pairing of batman and supermans mom is a really cool part of the story heartwarming <end>	<begin> oh wow batman aur superman ke mom ki pairing really sabse cool part tha story ka heartwarming <end>
<begin> i know but the film ends with sadly the death of superman <end>	<begin> i know but sadly fim ka end superman ki death ke sath hota hai <end>
<begin> oh wow i am surprised by that i thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two <end>	<begin> oh wow mujhe surprise hua isse i thought wo log apni story line ko aage badhne denge aage ki ek do aur movie ke liye <end>
<begin> dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the director <end>	<begin> dont worry coffin ke upar ki dhool ko hilte hue dikhaya director ne kisi badhiya wink ki tarah <end>
<begin> haha thats the closing shot <end>	<begin> haha wo to closing shot tha <end>
<begin> i believe so it is in the last scene <end>	<begin> i believe so ye last scene me ha na <end>
<begin> awesome take care <end>	<begin> awesome take care <end>
<begin> hello do you like superhero movies <end>	<begin> hello kya tumhe superhero movies pasand hai <end>
<begin> yes batman begins i think this a great batman film have you seen it <end>	<begin> haan batman begins mujhe lagta hai wo ek badhiya batman film hai kya tumne dekhi hai <end>
<begin> yes i have christian bale is my favorite batman so far <end>	<begin> haan maine dekhi hai christian bale mera ab tak ka favorite batman hai <end>
<begin> do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them <end>	<begin> kya tum usually movie dekhne se pahle uski ratings dekhte ho <end>
<begin> i usually do but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not <end>	<begin> usually haan but rating se ye determine nahi hota k main movie dekhunga ya nahi <end>
<begin> the film has several great big name actors which is another reason i like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone <end>	<begin> is film me bahut bade bade actors bhi hai jo ki ek aur reason hai aur actors dekh ke hi movie dekh lege <end>
<begin> i agree there are quite a few great actors in batman begins i like liam neeson too even though he is one of the villains <end>	<begin> main agree karta hu kuch bahut badhiya actors hai batman begins me mujhe liam neeson bhi pasand hai bhale hi wo ek villain hai <end>
<begin> seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest along with super heros and villans a good rating does help me feel like i will not waste my time watching something awful <end>	<begin> badhiya actors ka saath me badi screen me hone ka potential me definitely mera interest superheros aur villains k sath hi ek good rating se mujhe ye feel karne me asani hoti hai k kuch bekaar dekh k apna time waste nahi karra hai <end>
<begin> but the same time will not deter me from a film if i am just into the genre <end>	<begin> but at the same time wo mujhe movie dekhne se rok nahi sakta jiske genre me main bahut interested hu <end>
<begin> i personally prefer good ratings even if a movie has many good actors if its rated poorly i usually wont watch it in theaters <end>	<begin> mein good ratings ko prefer karthi agar movies mein kitne bhi ache actors hote tho bhi rated poorly hi dethe jo mein kabhi theaters mein nahi watch kartha <end>
<begin> im not sure if i agree with the metacritic score of <number> though <end>	<begin> mein itna sure nahi hein metacritic score <number> diya <end>
<begin> the <number> on rotten tomatoes seems more accurate <end>	<begin> rotten tomatoes ne <number> ne diya jo accurate hein <end>
<begin> i will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on dvd video if the rating turn me off <end>	<begin> mein tho patience se wait kartha aur dvd video me hi dekhta <end>
<begin> what did you think of the bat scene in the movie <end>	<begin> tho aapko is movie mein bat scene ke baare mein kya sochthe <end>
<begin> i felt that scene shows the story of this film well and is thought out <end>	<begin> muje laga us scene is story ko showup kiya jo thought out hein <end>
<begin> i wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well though <end>	<begin> muje lagtha hein ki bat keliya us dry well ke alava bhi aur kuch ache jhaga milega <end>
<begin> batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out <end>	<begin> batman bachon ko ache film hein kyon ki unhe life ka startup milega <end>
<begin> because this movie is called batman begins i agree that it was appropriate to show bruces beginnings <end>	<begin> are is movie ko batman begins ka naam diya hein lekin muje lagtha isko bruce ka beginning dena chahiye <end>
<begin> i think its ironic that the muggers name is joe chill but he isnt chill if he murders people <end>	<begin> haan joe chill ke liye tho yeh ironic hein kitna chill se voh people ko murder kartha <end>
<begin> unlikely yes i think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to the bats <end>	<begin> shayad han mujhe lagta hai ki wo log batman kaise bana uski mysterious shuruvat batane ja rahe the par thodi mystery choodna chahta hu kyuki use abhi bhi bats se phobia ho jata hai <end>
<begin> very ironic mr chill is more of a bone chilling murderer <end>	<begin> bahut ironic hai mr chill bone chilling murderer hai <end>
<begin> he is also murdered too so at least he gets what he deserves <end>	<begin> isne bhi khun kiya hai so jo woh deserve karta hai usko mil gaya <end>
<begin> he got whats coming to him but bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge <end>	<begin> usko pata chal gaya tha uske sath kya hone wala hai par bruce uska khun nahi karega isiliye muje lagta hai ki usme revenge ki bhavna rahegi <end>
<begin> i think it helps to establish that bruce will not directly murder anyone even when he burns down the league of shadows he doesnt directly kill ras al ghul <end>	<begin> mujhe lagta hai ki bruce kisika khun nahi karega aisa establish karna accha hoga woh jab league of shadows ko jala deta hai tab bhi woh ras al ghul ko directly nahi marega <end>
<begin> injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder in any case <end>	<begin> kisi bhi case me khun ka karan anyay nahi bataya ja sakta <end>
<begin> i feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows and to purge his fear of bats this key part i think is pretty lucky break for him as he is doing jail time in a foreign country <end>	<begin> woh lucky hai ki woh league of shadows ka part bana hai aur usne apne bats ke dar ko bhaga diya hai mujhe lagta hai ki yah important part uske liye lucky break sabit hoga kyuki woh foreign country ke jail me hai <end>
<begin> it is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing <end>	<begin> yah bilkul ajeeb baat hai ki iski family naukar afford kar shakti hai fir bhi wah jail me chori karne jata hai <end>
<begin> i really like gary oldman as gordon he plays a good cop really well <end>	<begin> gordon ke kirdar me mujhe gary oldman bahut accha lagta hai wah achhe police wale ka kirdar acchi tarah nibhata hai <end>
<begin> what did you think of the scarecrow scenes <end>	<begin> scarecow scenes ke bare me aapke kya vichar hain <end>
<begin> the scarecrow was particularly scary character trying to poison the water supply <end>	<begin> scarecrow tho badi scary character hein voh tho water supply ko poison kar raha tha <end>
<begin> and batman was poisoned with the fear inducing drugs i thought it was over for him <end>	<begin> aur batman bhi poisioned huva us fear inducing drugs se mein tho uska jaan khatre mein hein <end>
<begin> it appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points yeah <end>	<begin> uska character tho over ho chuka tha kahi movie mein <end>
<begin> i was surprised when the real ras al ghul showed himself too the league of shadows doesnt die easily <end>	<begin> muje tho surprised huva jab ras ka real face usne dekhayi tho voh league ka shadows bhi itna aasan nahi tha <end>
<begin> he seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences <end>	<begin> yeh tho otherworldy power ka surviving tho uska past experiences hein <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>
<begin> hello <end>	<begin> hello <end>
